; ----------------------
; Loaded in by the SF2TextEditor to visually replace text in the 'textbank' table with custom symbols.
; Allows the editor to work with non-ascii symbols without affecting any stored data (effectively making one symbol look like another).
; Still may require font symbols to be added to .\data\graphics\tech\fonts\variablewidthfont.bin.
; ----------------------
; Does not impact DISASM or game engine at all.
; Format is "x y" where x is an ascii character & y is a non-ascii character, separated by a space.
; Also supports unicode (u0000). e.g. "? u0278" replaces '?' with 'ɸ' symbol (since ɸ is not an ascii symbol).
