0323=Hawel must have been{N}killed by Galam....{W2}

0335=They were Galam soldiers.{N}They demanded my notes on{N}Ground Seal.{W2}{N}They suddenly snatched at{N}them, and...(cough)...{W1}

0339=What?!  The door opened?{N}Who broke the ancient{N}seal?! {W1}
033A=Calm down, sir.{N}Why are you so excited?{W1}
033B=(Cough, cough)...{NAME;4},{N}listen to me carefully.{N}Grans Island is lost!{W2}{N}That tower is the sacred{N}seal that confines a terrible{N}devil.{W2}{N}Two jewels...(cough)...{N}were...installed to...{W1}

0343=This is the treasure room!{N}You may not pass!{W1}
0344=It's true that the messenger{N}met with an unnatural death.{W2}
0345=But, that doesn't mean that{N}Granseal did it....{W2}
0346=I don't understand.{N}Why is King Galam so{N}impatient?{W1}
0347=When the messenger was found{N}dead, the King suffured a{N}great deal of pain.{W2}
0348=Thank goodness, he{N}recovered quickly.{W2}
0349=It's Granseals fault!{W2}

0403={LEADER}!  Your father{N}was also very curious.{W2}
0404=He must be indigenous to{N}the mainland.{W1}
0405=What a big bird!{N}How beautiful!{N}It's legendary!{W1}
0406=Wow!  It's very big!{N}He doesn't wear anything!{W2}
0407=I've seen many animal-like{N}races here, but they all{N}wore clothes!{W1}
0408=Mmmmm!  He's shining.{N}Is this a bird or a god?{W1}
0409=Hey, why don't you touch it?{N}It may be a stuffed animal!{W1}
040A=I can't see!{N}I can't see!{W1}
040B=This is boring!{W1}
040C=I'll miss you, {LEADER}.{N}I must find another customer.{W1}

0424=Oh, it's you, {LEADER}.{N}I'll never forget you.{N}Thanks for saving me!{W1}
0425=The Minister was upset...{W2}
0426=He looked at me scornfully.{N}I will be disciplined!{W1}
0427=Listen, I've invented{N}something!{N}An explosive!{W2}
0428=You can blow up the rocks{N}blocking the North Cave{N}with it!{W2}
0429=Ah...no you can't.{N}You'll be blown up too!{W1}
042A=A strange animal?{N}Really?{W1}
042B=Yeah!  It's a very big bird!{W1}

0439=Stop!  Stop this!{W1}
043A=Amazing!  He speaks!{W1}
043B=Of course I do.{W2}

043D=Shut up, bird!{W1}
043E=How barbaric!{W2}
043F=I didn't know humans were{N}so impolite.{W1}
0440=What?{W1}
0441=Those boys are about to{N}hit the bird.{W1}
0442=Stop!{W1}
0443=What do you think you're{N}doing?{W1}
0444=I'm sorry.  I must apologize{N}for their actions.{W2}

0458=How have you been,{N}{LEADER}.{N}Oh, you look strong.{W1}
0459=I'm not allowed to go out{N}'cause it's so dangerous.{W1}
045A=Sir Astral forbids me to use{N}the dynamite.{W2}
045B=I need his permission to give{N}it to you.{W1}
045C=Sir Astral, may I give him{N}the dynamite?{W1}
045D=It's too dangerous to use it{N}as it is.{W2}
045E=We need some way to{N}detonate the dynamite{N}safely.{W1}
045F=Oh, that cannon would be{N}perfect!{W1}
0460=Sir Astral said it was OK!{N}Here is the explosive.{W1}

0471=But, we will be better off{N}if there are no accidents.{W2}
0472=You're too young to spend{N}your time guarding our new{N}home.{W2}
0473=You are the soldiers of{N}Granseal!{W2}
0474=Do your best to improve our{N}new home!{W1}

0482=Indeed, indeed.{N}Thank you, sir!{W1}
0483=That's all for today.{N}You may go now.{W1}

04B2=God?  Ah, Volcanon!{N}{NAME;10} calls him a god. {W2}
04B3=As long as he watches over{N}us, nothing can break the{N}peace of Parmecia.{W1}

04B5=Oh, this is the happiest day{N}of my life!{W1}
04B6=Please let me go with you{N}and meet Volcanon!{W1}

04D7=The most important thing is{N}to defeat the devils!{W1}
04D8=How long should I keep{N}guard here?{W1}
04D9=To Grans Island?  But, I{N}like Parmecia now!{W1}
04DA=We'll guard Granseal while{N}you're away!{W1}

04F6=What should we do now?{W1}
04F7=Easy, we have to defeat{N}Zeon and save Elis!{W1}
04F8=Impossible!{W1}
04F9=The King is right.{W1}

0503=Be careful, Astral.{W2}
0504=It's dangerous out there.{W1}
0505=I will!{W1}
0506={LEADER}.{W2}
0507=I'm going with you as an{N}adviser.{W1}
0508=Adviser Astral has joined the{N}force.
0509=We have to remove the rocks{N}blocking the passageway{N}leading to North Parmecia.{W2}{N}Maybe we can use an{N}explosive!{W1}
050A=One year has passed.{W1}

0510=Soldiers must be waiting{N}beyond the gate.{N}Be careful!{W1}
0511=You're so persistent.{N}What do you want?!{W2}
0512=You suddenly appear in{N}Parmecia, and build a castle?{W2}
0513=I don't know who you are,{N}but all big cities like war!{W2}
0514=I've never seen such{N}impolite and violent guests!{W1}

051C=Why?{W1}
051D=I'm not from Granseal.{N}I just visited there....{W2}
051E=You think they came to{N}Parmecia to conquer it?{N}Well, you're wrong.{W2}
051F=They were forced to leave{N}their island due to a{N}disaster.{W2}

0529=Our ancestors came from{N}Rune, a southern island,{N}long ago.{W2}
052A=Since then, we've travelled{N}up here.{W2}
052B=The mountains to the north{N}block our journey.{W2}
052C=Are you going to{N}Mt. Volcano?{N}That's {NAME;7}'s hometown?{W1}
052D=We won't hide from you{N}anymore.  Ribble has many{N}ancient ruins.{W1}
052E=Men are so selfish.{N}My husband has gone to the{N}east to work.  What about me?{W1}
052F=Keseran is a historian.{N}But Mr. {NAME;11} is smarter{N}than him!{W2}
0530=I saw a strange hollow in a{N}tree.  Does something go{N}there?{W2}
0531=Is what you're looking for in{N}Ribble?{W1}
0532=I can't find it!{W2}
0533=The hidden door to the{N}ancient ruins must be near{N}this tree!{W1}
0534=To Mt. Volcano?{W1}
0535=Go east and then go north{N}along the river.  A cave is{N}there.{W2}

0563=Hmmm...and what happened{N}to Max?{W1}
0564=He wasn't found in Parmecia,{N}so maybe he went to Grans.{N}I'm not really sure.{W2}
0565=I think I'll take a nap{N}now.  Bye.{W1}
0566=(Sniff)...(sniff)...I smell{N}something old....{W1}

058D=Through the cave?{N}Nobody has come to this{N}village since...{W2}
058E=Oh, you defeated that{N}hobgoblin?  Wow!{W2}
058F=Now we can use that tunnel{N}to travel between Polca and{N}the wilderness area!{W1}
0590=Breathe deeply....{W2}{N}Wonderful air, huh?{W1}
0591=In ancient times, there{N}were magic tunnels.{W2}{N}People traveled easily{N}through the tunnels.{W1}
0592=To the east is the sacred{N}area of Volcanon.{W1}
0593=Mt. Volcano is home to{N}beastmen.{W2}{N}We were a warlike tribe, but{N}we've almost forgotten how{N}to fight.{W1}
0594=Young men these days are{N}lucky!  I wish I was young{N}again!{W1}
0595=You're not aware, but{N}Volcanon has become{N}irritated...{W1}
0596=...like that!  And, it's getting{N}worse.{N}What's wrong you ask?{W1}
0597=Whoa!  Mt. Volcano erupted!{W2}
0598=It's an evil omen.{W1}
0599=Clank!  Clank!{N}All of our weapons are made{N}by me!{W2}{N}But, who uses them in this{N}peaceful country?{W1}
059A=Hirsute?  'Cause I'm a{N}beastman.{W2}{N}I'm not hairy enough though.{N}I envy those hairy guys!{W1}
059B=Help!  Help!{N}I can't...get up!{W2}{N}You, please turn me over!{W1}
059C=Are you a wimp?{N}Push harder!{W1}

05A0=They say, a huge monster{N}lives in the river.{W1}
05A1=You saw Volcanon?{N}Are you serious?{W2}{N}I've never met him, though{N}I've lived here all my life.{W1}
05A2=There's a desert in the south.{W2}{N}Ancient ruins lay in the{N}desert.{W1}
05A3=I could help you if I were{N}younger.{W2}{N}But now I'm too darn old.{N}Drat!{W1}
05A4=Before we knew...we tried{N}to avoid the fighting....{W1}
05A5=Clank!  Clank!{W2}{N}I heard that blacksmiths in{N}ancient times made special{N}weapons from a rare metal.{W1}
05A6=I need more hair and more{N}courage!{W2}{N}I couldn't move when I{N}saw the devils....{W1}

05AF=Mayor, mayor!{W1}
05B0=What's all this noise?{W1}
05B1=Mayor, a boy from the mountain{N}is seriously injured!{W1}
05B2=What?!{W1}
05B3=Ohhh...his eyes are{N}seriously damaged!{W2}
05B4=He must have been caught{N}in the eruption....{W1}
05B5=He needs prompt treatment!{W1}
05B6=Yes!  Bring him into my house!{W1}
05B7=Oh, this is serious!{N}I hope he survives the night.{W1}
05B8=Ah...stop...no!{N}I don't want...to see....{N}My...head...aches....{W1}
05B9=He came down from the{N}mountain....{W2}
05BA=He's not from Polca, or{N}Bedoe....{W2}
05BB=Where did he come from?{W1}
05BC=Bedoe soldiers are cowards!{W1}
05BD=Be quiet!{W1}
05BE=My comrades!{W1}

05C7=I came here to get a raft{N}for you.{W2}
05C8=The people of Polca are{N}being controlled by these{N}devils.  They deceived me!{W1}
05C9=Prince {NAME;10}, I'm sorry.{W1}

05D4=What?!{W1}
05D5=The mayor examines {NAME;10}{N}carefully.{W1}
05D6=You're warm!  You're alive!{W1}
05D7=I really regret all of this.{W2}
05D8=Suddenly, the devils{N}appeared.{W2}
05D9=We had no power to resist{N}them.{W2}
05DA=They promised they would do{N}nothing if we gave Oddler{N}to them.{W1}
05DB=And you sent ME in Oddler's{N}place?!{W1}
05DC=I'm sorry, please don't{N}tell King Bedoe!{W1}
05DD=Alright, I won't...{W2}
05DE=If you prepare a raft for{N}{LEADER}.{W1}
05DF=Oh, thank you!{N}A raft, OK.{W1}
05E0=Hey, Ripster!{W1}
05E1=Yes.{W1}
05E2=Prepare a raft for{N}Prince {NAME;10}.{W1}
05E3=But, it's the last one we{N}have...{W1}
05E4=I don't care!{W2}
05E5=You can make another if{N}necessary, can't you?!{W1}
05E6=Y...yes, sir!{W1}
05E7=A raft will be waiting for{N}you on the river.{W2}
05E8=Why don't you take a look{N}at it right now?{W1}
05E9=He wants to get rid of us.{W1}
05EA=You're right.{W1}
05EB=Anyway, now we have a raft!{W1}
05EC=Let's go!{W1}
05ED=Just a minute.{W1}
05EE=If it's possible...{W1}
05EF=Please take this boy with{N}you.{W1}
05F0=You lazy human!{W2}
05F1=You don't want to take care{N}of him!{W1}
05F2=I...er....{W1}
05F3={LEADER}, will you take{N}
05F4=him with us?{W1}
05F5=I agree.  Our journey will{N}be too difficult on him,{N}as he is blind.{W2}
05F6=Mayor, we can't take him,{N}we're sorry.{W1}
05F7=B...but....{W1}
05F8=Are you serious?{N}{LEADER}, you're too nice.{W1}
05F9=Oh, thank you!{W1}
05FA=Oddler, {LEADER} will{N}take you.{W2}
05FB=You can trust him!{W1}
05FC=Thank you very much.{W1}
05FD=Watch out!{W2}
05FE=Be careful.{W1}
05FF=Yes, I will....{W1}
0600=I'm Oddler.{N}I was nearly dead when I{N}came here.{W2}
0601=Actually, I don't remember....{W2}
0602=I don't know the reason why{N}the devils are after me.{W2}
0603=I'm afraid I'll cause you a{N}lot of trouble.{W1}
0604={LEADER} decides to{N}take Oddler with him.{W1}
0605=Wait, wait!{W1}
0606=Please, let me go with you!{W1}
0607=Huh?{W1}
0608=Watch out!{W2}
0609=Be careful.{W1}
060A=Yes, I will....{W1}
060B=As long as I'm here the{N}devils will return.{W2}
060C=Maybe {LEADER} is strong{N}enough to resist them?{W1}
060D=But, you may be injured!{W1}
060E=Well, I think he should come{N}with us.{W2}
060F=If we left him here, he{N}could be killed.{W2}
0610=It's too dangerous, isn't it,{N}{LEADER}?{W1}
0611=He needs a guardian.{W2}
0612=I'll take care of him.{W1}
0613=OK.  Let's go.{W1}
0614=Now, let's go to Devil's Tail{N}to see Creed!{W1}
0615=It sounds like {NAME;10} is{N}going with us.{W1}
0616=I am.  I want to fight with{N}{LEADER}.{W2}
0617=This might be exciting!{W1}
0618=I didn't know you were such{N}an adventurer!{W1}
0619=Alright!{N}Wow!  Let's go!{W1}
061A=The devils were almost{N}annihilated before.{N}
061B=Why did they attack Bedoe?{W1}
061C=Creed is the last greater{N}devil to survive the war.{W2}
061D=But he retired from the army{N}and now lives alone in{N}Devil's Tail.{W1}
061E=Uuuu...ooo....{N}He's...a...terrible...{W1}
061F=Oh, nightmares again.{W2}
0620=What did he see in that war?{W1}
0621=Mighty Volcanon!  He easily{N}defeated the greater devil!{W1}
0622=Ouch...the greater devil was{N}incredibly strong.{W2}
0623=But the other devils were{N}strong as well!{W1}
0624=They know that they can't{N}defeat our God.{W2}
0625=What was their true{N}purpose?{W1}
0626=Kneel before King Bedoe.{N}Just kidding.{W1}
0627=I protect the King!{W1}
0628=(Burp)...I'm not afraid{N}of devils...{W2}
0629=as long as I drink a{N}rootbeer first...(burp).{W1}
062A=They're neurotics!{W2}
062B=Everybody was shocked to{N}see the greater devil.{W1}
062C=Yes, they were strong.{N}But...{W2}
062D=Monsters like the Kraken and{N}Taros are much bigger!{W1}
062E=My spouse was...killed...{N}in the war....{W1}
062F=Zzzz...dad, no...come back...!{W1}
0630=The devils?!  I thought they{N}were only an old legend.{W1}
0631=I never let my hatchling{N}go out!{W1}
0632=Have you seen my dad?{N}Mom won't tell me anyhting{N}about him.{W1}
0633=We have a lot of weapons,{N}but I don't want to use any{N}of them!{W1}
0634=I'm bored!{N}I want to go out!{W2}
0635=How wonderful it would be to{N}fly on such a beautiful day!{W1}
0636=We need a lot of hot water{N}to treat these injured men.{W2}
0637=I've been standing here all{N}day!{W1}
0638=Huh?{W1}
0639=If...God Volcanon doesn't{N}calm down...{W1}
063A=Something happened in{N}North Parmecia.{W2}
063B=I saw a strange cloud!{W1}
063C=Goddess Mitula lives on the{N}north side of Tristan through{N}the mountains.{W2}
063D=The people living in Tristan{N}are kind, but weak.{N}I wonder if they are alright?{W1}
063E=We can't calm down{N}Volcanon.{W2}
063F=Without his protection, the{N}people that live on the{N}ground will perish.{W2}
0640=Only Tristan and Bedoe{N}will survive.{W1}
0641=Volcanon was very angry,{N}wasn't he?{W2}
0642=We can no longer depend on{N}him.  We must do it{N}ourselves!{W1}
0643=God Volcanon has forsaken{N}the people of the Earth.{W2}
0644=Are you going to kill Zeon{N}as he demanded?{W1}
0645=Then you may stay in Bedoe.{W2}
0646=You'll be safe here.{W1}
0647=You're a man of honor!{N}Why don't you go see Creed?{W2}
0648=He's an ex-greater devil.{N}He may give you some{N}information.{W2}
0649=You must travel along the{N}river to get to Creed's{N}mansion.{W2}
064A=Maybe Polca has a raft for{N}you.{W1}
064B=Tell the mayor to prepare a{N}raft.{W1}
064C=Yes, sir!{W1}
064D={NAME;7}, please{N}help {LEADER}.{W2}
064E={LEADER}, good luck!{W1}
064F=Shhhh!  My hatchling is{N}sleeping.  Quiet!{W1}
0650=Who are you?{W1}
0651=Bedoe is only for birdmen!{W1}
0652=Don't be so uppity!{W1}
0653=Oh, you're...{W1}
0654=Sir {NAME;7}!{N}Sorry, Sir {NAME;7}!{W2}
0655=Welcome back!{N}Volcanon is waiting!{W1}
0656=That's strange...{W2}
0657=I just realized...{N}Why are you flying guard?{W2}
0658=Did something happen?{W1}
0659=Well, the devils invaded{N}recently.{W1}
065A=Devils?{W1}
065B=Yes, the Devil Army.{W2}
065C=Strong greater devils broke{N}Volcanon's sacred barrier.{W2}
065D=But don't worry, Volcanon{N}defeated all the devils.{W1}
065E=The devils we fought must{N}have been part of that army!{W1}
065F=You met some other devils?{W1}
0660=Stop, stop!{W2}
0661=We already defeated them.{W1}
0662=That's great!  But...{W2}
0663=We'll go and make sure...{W1}
0664=Just in case.{W1}
0665=We're going to Polca Village{N}to patrol.{W2}
0666={NAME;7}, please see{N}King Bedoe.{W1}
0667={LEADER}, let's go.{W2}
0668=I'll introduce you to{N}King Bedoe.{W1}
0669=Yes, the greater devil was{N}very strong.{W1}
066A=But, God Volcanon swept{N}away all the devils.{W1}
066B=What about the greater{N}devil?{W1}
066C=He fled.{W1}
066D=Can't you track him?{W2}
066E=We must capture him before{N}he regains his strength.{W1}
066F=Did they come from Grans{N}Island?{W1}
0670=I think so.{W2}
0671=Maybe he died.{N}But beware of another attack.{W2}
0672=Watch carefully!{W1}
0673={NAME;7}, {NAME;7}!{W1}
0674={NAME;10}, how have you been?{W2}
0675=King Bedoe, you look well.{W1}
0676={NAME;7}, my friend, how{N}was your journey?{W1}
0677=Let me introduce my friend.{W1}
0678=This is {LEADER}.{N}He's from Grans and...{W1}
0679=I know.  He is a pupil of{N}Astral of Granseal.{W1}
067A=How do you know that?{W1}
067B=Sir Astral told me.{W1}
067C=What?!  Did you go to{N}Granseal?{W1}
067D=As Volcanon's messenger.{W1}
067E=And I heard that somebody{N}unsealed Zeon.{W2}
067F=Grans people caused a big,{N}big problem.{W2}
0680=Zeon might destroy the{N}world...{W1}
0681=Sorry to interrupt, but is{N}he that strong?{W1}
0682=Zeon is King of the Devils.{W1}
0683={NAME;7}, you had better{N}go see Volcanon.{W2}
0684=It may calm him down to see{N}{NAME;7}.{W1}
0685=Oh, is he angry?{N}Maybe later...{W1}
0686=Never mind later.{N}He has been waiting for you.{W1}
0687=Oh, yeah?  OK, I'm going.{W2}
0688={LEADER}, follow me.{W1}
0689={NAME;7}, are you taking{N}{LEADER} with you?{W1}
068A=Of course.  Why not?{W1}
068B=He thinks the people of{N}Granseal are...{W1}
068C=King Bedoe, I think{N}{LEADER} has to see{N}Volcanon.{W2}
068D=He should talk to him.{W1}
068E=Hmmm...you're right.{N}{NAME;7}, go ahead.{W1}
068F=OK.{N}Anyway, let's go.{W1}
0690=I had a dream last night.{N}I flew!{W2}
0691=Watch!  I can fly!{W1}
0692=Hmmm...strange...{W1}
0693=That didn't work.  Hee, hee.{W2}
0694=Stay there.{N}I know I can fly!{W1}
0695=See.  I told you!{N}I can fly...sort of.{W1}
0696=Ha, ha, ha!{W1}

0698=Oh my, {NAME;20}!{W1}
0699=Thank you!  Thank you!{N}{NAME;20} is OK.{W1}
069A=Welcome.  Travelers often{N}stop by here to rest.{W2}
069B=You may stay here as{N}long as you like.{W1}
069C=They say a fairy lives{N}around here.{N}Do you know her?{W1}
069D=Fairy?{W2}
069E=She has not returned{N}from Creed's mansion.{W1}
069F=To Creed's Mansion?{N}Only the fairy knows how to{N}get there.{W2}
06A0=But, maybe {NAME;13} knows{N}because he is a friend of{N}the fairy.{W1}
06A1={NAME;13} is out.{N}He went to find the fairy{N}to help a sick dwarf.{W2}
06A2=The forest to the west is{N}very dangerous.{W1}
06A3=A forest elf always returns{N}one's kindness.{W2}
06A4={LEADER}, I think{N}{NAME;13} will help you.{W1}
06A5=Hey, you met Creed, didn't{N}you?{W1}
06A6=The evil has completely{N}lifted from the forest.{W1}
06A7=Is that sick dwarf better?{W2}
06A8=Can he see the fairy now?{W1}
06A9=We came from Grans to look{N}for Mithril.{W1}
06AA=Recent earthquakes have{N}buried the tunnel.{W2}{N}My friend is sick now, and{N}we can't dig out the tunnel{N}without him.{W1}
06AB=(Shiver)...cold...{N}Oh...I'm so cold....{W1}
06AC=One of us went to look for{N}the fairy.{W2}{N}I hope he's alright.{W1}
06AD=Dig, dig!{N}Hey hoo, hey hoo!{W2}{N}To Grans we are a diggin'!{N}Hey hoo, hey hoo!{W1}
06AE=Hey, visit us in the Dwarven{N}Village when you come to{N}Grans!{W1}
06AF=Where is the sick dwarf?{W1}
06B0=Oh, thank goodness.{N}I sure am glad to see you.{W1}
06B1=Here, please examine him.{W1}
06B2=Oh, I hope I'm not too late.{W2}
06B3=Ok, let's see.{W1}
06B4=How is he?{W1}
06B5=I don't know yet....{W1}

06BF=We all thank you.{N}Take this gift.{W1}
06C0={LEADER} is given a{N}Cannon.{W1}

06C2=We use it to destroy large{N}rocks.{W1}
06C3=OK, guys!{N}Let's go back to Grans{N}Island!{W2}
06C4=Everybody dig!{W1}
06C5=(Sniff, sniff)...{N}It smells like a ditch!{W1}
06C6=Is this the smell of the{N}devils that they were{N}talking about?{W1}
06C7=Hee, hee!{W1}
06C8=What huge rats!{W1}
06C9=Welcome!{W2}
06CA=It's dinner time!{W1}
06CB=The Cotton Balloon popped.{W1}
06CC=Ungh!{W2}
06CD=It's too heavy. I can't{N}lift it.  I give up!{W1}
06CE=You want to see Creed?{N}Are you serious?!{W2}
06CF=A hole in the wall leads{N}to Creed, but don't use it!{W1}
06D0=We came down here to{N}escape, but devils live in{N}the tunnel....{W2}
06D1=They're too ferocious!{N}I'm gonna stay in Floor{N}World.{W1}
06D2=We left Desktop Kingdom long{N}ago.{W2}
06D3={NAME;16} is a brave leader.{N}We trust him!{W1}
06D4=What happened?{W2}
06D5=A strange feeling swept over{N}me when I entered that door.{W2}
06D6=Then, it felt like...I was{N}lifted upward!{W1}
06D7=It's very difficult to explain{N}what's happened to us....{W2}
06D8=Anyway, we're very small now.{W1}
06D9=Small?  How small?{W1}
06DA=Let's see...now we're on a{N}desk...and it's very large,{N}like a village.{W1}
06DB=Exactly.{W1}
06DC=Goliath!{W2}
06DD=Hey, what did you do to us?{W1}
06DE=I told you not to go in{N}there.  You didn't listen{N}to my warning.{W2}
06DF=You guys look so cute!{N}Ha, ha!{N}Bye, little kiddies!{W1}
06E0={LEADER}, cheer up!{W2}
06E1=Let's look around this{N}Desktop Kingdom.{W1}
06E2=I agree!  We can meet Creed{N}later.{W1}
06E3=??{W1}
06E4=Hi, stranger!{N}How are you?{W2}
06E5=Is it still beautiful outside?{N}I want to go.{W1}
06E6=Creed is a fine gentleman.{W2}
06E7=His magic saved us a long time{N}ago during a natural disaster.{W1}
06E8=Devils cannot use their magic{N}to affect human lives.{W2}
06E9=Supposedly, it's one of their{N}rules.{W1}
06EA=This Kingdom was made by{N}Creed.  There's no concept{N}of TIME here.{W2}
06EB=We never get old.{N}We never die.{N}What is the meaning of life?{W1}
06EC=I was there during the{N}disaster.{W2}
06ED=I was looking for the{N}legendary sword.{N}I hate it here!{W1}
06EE=Are you from the outside?{N}Why did you come here?{W2}
06EF=Ah, a mistake.  I see.{W2}
06F0=I suggest you see King{N}Ponpei.{N}He's a good man.{W1}
06F1=I'm sure King Ponpei will{N}help you.{W1}
06F2=So, you were not able to see{N}Creed?{W2}
06F3=Somewhere in Floor World,{N}there's a tunnel that leads{N}to Creed.{W2}
06F4=OK, I'll let you go if you{N}win a game against my army.{W2}
06F5=You may go to the chessboard{N}now.{W1}
06F6=The army won't attack until{N}you reach the center of the{N}board.{W1}
06F7=The Chess Army is very{N}strong.{W2}
06F8=It will be good training for{N}you.{W1}
06F9=Mr. Creed gave me this solid,{N}armored body!{W1}
06FA=My attack power is the best{N}in the army!{W1}
06FB=We knights are always ready{N}to fight!{W1}
06FC=Is healing is my only ability?{N}Ha, ha!  You have a lot to{N}learn!{W1}
06FD=I lead the army with the King.{W1}
06FE=The Chess Army of Desktop{N}Kingdom is a well balanced{N}force!{W2}
06FF=If it is King Ponpei's wish,{N}we will accept your{N}challenge!{W1}
0700=Are you ready?{W2}
0701=Now, start the battle!{N}Do your best!{W1}
0702=Checkmate!{N}This is for you.{W1}
0703=A Cotton Balloon is inside.{W2}
0704=With it you can leave{N}Desktop Kingdom safely.{N}Good luck!{W1}
0705=Bravo!  I'd give you an army{N}if you'd stay here.{W1}
0706=He's just kidding, but to{N}tell the truth, the Cotton{W2}
0707=Balloon is a very special{N}treasure.{W1}
0708=Some adventurers live in the{N}north-east part of Floor{W2}
0709=World.  Please visit them?{W1}
070A=Halt!  I can't let you{N}pass without the King's{N}permission.{W1}
070B=Floor World is very{N}dangerous.  Take care!{W1}
070C=You may go now.{N}I need to talk to fairy.{W1}
070D=Yes, sir.{W1}
070E=Tum-de-dum-dum.  Oh...{N}Time to check the{N}collections.{W1}
070F=Servant Goliath unlocks the{N}door.{W1}
0710=Excuse me.{W1}
0711=Yeow!{W1}
0712=Y...yes?{W1}
0713=We've come to see Mr. Creed.{W1}
0714=My master?{W2}
0715=Do you have an appointment?{W1}
0716=A what?{W1}
0717=No, not yet, but...{W1}
0718=I'm sorry, but he's busy now.{W2}
0719=Please come back later.{W1}
071A=We can't see Mr. Creed now.{W1}
071B=No kidding!{W2}
071C={LEADER}, {NAME;7}, let's{N}force our way into the room!{W1}
071D=Oddler, you're getting bold.{W2}
071E=But, it is a good idea.{W1}
071F=Hmmmph....{W1}
0720=Let's go!{W1}
0721=How did he do that?{W1}
0722=You impolite kids!{N}You can't go in!{W2}
0723=Mr. Creed is too busy!{N}Go away!{W1}
0724={LEADER}, on our left!{N}That door might lead to{N}Mr. Creed!{W2}
0725=Let's ditch this guy and go{N}through that door.{W1}
0726={LEADER}, let's do it!{N}I don't want to fail now!{W1}
0727=OK, OK.  We give up.{W2}
0728=We'll see Mr. Creed later.{N}Let's get out of here.{W1}
0729=Yeah, maybe later.{W1}
072A=No, don't go in there!{N}That door is...!{W1}
072B=What stupid kids!{W1}
072C=Whoever passes through this{N}magic door becomes small.{W2}
072D=That is, anybody who's not{N}protected by Mr. Creed.{W1}
072E=Goliath picks up{N}{LEADER}.{W1}
072F=Now, you're part of the{N}collection!{W1}
0730=Goliath...Goliath!{W1}
0731=Goliath!!!{W1}
0732=I'm here!  I'm coming!{W1}
0733=Yes, Mr. Creed?{W1}
0734=My collection is rather noisy{N}today.{W1}
0735=Oh, yes...ah...{W1}
0736=What?{W1}
0737=No, I...I added to your{N}collection today.{W1}
0738=You did what?!{W1}
0739=I'm sorry!{W2}
073A=I tried to stop them, but they{N}jumped through the magic door.{W1}
073B=You didn't lock the door, did{N}you?{W2}
073C=I told you to always lock{N}that door!{W1}
073D=Anyway, I want to see them.{W1}
073E=Right away, sir!{W1}
073F=What?{W1}
0740=Ah...{W1}
0741=I heard something.{W1}
0742=Are you Mr. Creed?{W1}
0743=Oh, someone from my{N}collection is talking!{W2}
0744=You must be one of the people{N}Goliath was talking about.{W1}
0745=We came to see you.{W2}
0746=Please return us to our{N}original size.{W1}
0747=You came to see me?{W2}
0748=Hmmm...why?{W1}
0749=Make us bigger.  My neck{N}hurts from looking up at you!{W1}
074A=Oh, sorry. {W1}
074B=Abra kadabra!  1-2-3!{W1}
074C=Wow, we're back to normal!{N}I can't believe we were so{N}small!{W1}
074D=Now, why did you want to see{N}me?{W1}
074E=Oh, yes!{N}We want to know about Zeon!{W1}
074F=Zeon?{W1}
0750=You said Zeon?{W1}
0751=The King of the Devils who is{N}sealed in Arc Valley?{W1}
0752=Did something happen to{N}Zeon?  Has he revived?{W1}
0753={LEADER} nods.{W1}
0754=No way!  You're kidding!{N}I can't believe it!{W1}
0755=Noisy fairy!{N}Be quiet!{W1}
0756=Is what you say true?{W1}
0757={LEADER} nods again.{W1}
0758=So, Zeon will appear again....{N}He will destroy everything.{W1}
0759=Sir, the new additions to{N}your collection are missing!{W1}
075A=I know.{W1}
075B=How...?{W1}
075C=It doesn't matter how!{N}Now, go away!{W1}
075D=Wow!  I can't believe this{N}is happening!{W1}
075E=You know, Grans Island is{N}covered by a dark cloud.{W2}
075F=At the same time, North{N}Parmecia has had no rain.{W2}
0760=South Parmecia is OK, but....{W1}
0761=That's because of Volcanon.{W2}
0762=I fear for Mitula....{W1}
0763=Volcanon and Mitula are{N}invulnerable to everything, {N}except Zeon!{W2}
0764=Indeed...Zeon is extremely{N}powerful!{W1}
0765=Zeon?  Oh, gosh!{W1}
0766=Goliath!  What are you still{N}doing here?!{W1}
0767=I have no time to scold you{N}now!{W2}
0768=Evil Spirit may know{N}something.{W1}
0769=You guys, follow him.{N}Follow him!{W1}

076D=Oh, is a dwarf sick?{N}Really?{W2}
076E=OK, I think I can help him.{N}Bring me to him.{W1}
076F={LEADER} decides to{N}take the fairy with him.{W1}
0770=Arc Valley was unsealed and{N}Zeon woke up?{W2}{N}This is a nightmare!{W1}
0771=My master would like to{N}help you, {LEADER}.{W2}
0772=Please choose one.{W1}
0773=I'm {NAME;14}, a knight.{N}I was looking for a magic{N}sword.{W2}
0774=I would do anything for{N}Mr. Creed!  Please choose me.{W1}
0775=What a pity...then, I wish{N}happiness to all of you.{W1}

077E=You...snot nose!{W1}
077F=Hey, you're going east,{N}right?{N}I'm going with you!{W1}
0780=I really want to find the{N}legendary magic sword....{W2}
0781=But I can't do that if I'm{N}stuck here.{W2}{N}May I join your force?{W1}
0782=No?  Then I'll continue my{N}search for the legendary{N}magic sword alone.{W1}
0783=I was surprised to find I{N}had returned to my original{N}size!{W2}
0784=What should I do now?{N}I can go anywhere...{N}maybe...with you?{W1}
0785=Fine!  I'll stay in this{N}mansion then.{W1}
0786=I'm not sure why, but I'm{N}free.{W2}
0787=Can I join your force?{W1}
0788=You may regret refusing me.{W1}
0789=I'm free!  Fresh air smells{N}so good!{W2}
078A=Where should I go?{N}Hey, may I go with you?{W1}
078B=Why, how rude!{W1}

0790=Won't you, Oddler?{W1}
0791=Oddler, is this true?{W1}
0792=I don't know why, but I{N}would like to stay.{W2}
0793=No, I must stay here....{N}I must stay here....{W1}
0794=He's weak.{W2}
0795=He had better stay.{N}Say farewell.{W1}
0796=It was great travelling with{N}you {LEADER}.{W2}
0797=Thank you.  Please be{N}careful.{W1}
0798={LEADER}, you'll learn{N}the reason why he has to stay{N}here soon enough.{W2}
0799=Don't think about it now.{N}Go to the north.{W1}
079A=We devils can't help you.{W2}
079B=People of the Earth have{N}to seal Zeon again by{N}themselves.{W1}
079C=Hello, {LEADER}.{N}How are you?{W2}
079D=I'm well...but, I've had a{N}bad headache lately.{W1}
079E=Is he getting back his{N}memory yet?{W2}

07A8=From South Parmecia?{N}Why did you come here?{W2}
07A9=Pacalon has become isolated{N}since we opposed the devils.{W2}
07AA=If I were you, I'd leave.{W1}
07AB=It's unusually hot!{W2}
07AC=Is Mitula as sick as I've{N}heard?{W1}
07AD=The devils forbade us to go{N}out. {W1}
07AE=Blast!  I hate devils....{W1}
07AF=Ah, are you a customer?{N}Wow!{W2}
07B0=It's a secret, OK?{N}I have very good weapons.{N}Hee, hee.{W2}

07B6=But, now we can't sell our{N}weapons because of the{N}devils!{W2}
07B7=Annoying devils!{W1}
07B8=Oh, sorry.{W2}
07B9=I don't want to bother you.{W1}
07BA=You again?{N}Bye now.{W1}
07BB=Tristan is ruled by the{N}Goddess Mitula.{W2}
07BC=So, we have no king.{W1}
07BD=Devils?  They'd better not{N}come to Parmecia...{W2}
07BE=as long as Mitula and{N}Volcanon are watching!{W1}
07BF=I've not seen her here, but{N}she is in the shrine.{W2}
07C0=Mitula Shrine is behind the{N}caverns of Tristan.{W1}
07C1=Storytellers in the shrine{N}tell us the legends of the{N}world.{W2}
07C2=Sometimes, it's difficult for{N}us to understand their true{N}meanings.{W1}
07C3=It hasn't rained here lately?{N}No kidding!{W2}
07C4=Everything is OK, as long as{N}Mitula is here.{W1}
07C5=Oh, you're from South{N}Parmecia?  Welcome!{W2}

07CE=Will Tristan be attacked?{W1}
07CF=It's said that some devils{N}steal your spirit.{W2}
07D0=If your spirit is stolen, you{N}become a vampire.{W1}
07D1=Have you seen a vampire?{W2}
07D2=A vampire becomes a mortal{N}again if the devil is purged{N}from the body.{W1}
07D3=I did see a ship in the{N}western sky!{W1}

0890=Astral glares at {LEADER}.{W1}

08B8=Anywhere.  There!{N}No!  There!{W1}
08B9=But, the ship will be{N}destroyed!{W1}

08ED=I think it's too dangerous{N}out there alone.{W1}
08EE=And...{W2}
08EF=It would be safer if we came{N}along.  Let's go.{W1}
08F0=Look at that, {LEADER}!{N}They've finished breaking{N}up the ship.{W1}
08F1=Wow, there's our new town!{W2}

0911=That lad is their leader.{N}Take him!{W1}
0912=Don't worry.  He has only{N}fainted.  Take them to Galam!{W1}
0913=You, rat!  I threw you into{N}jail after I took your{N}jewels....{W1}
0914=Hee, hee!  You expect a thief{N}to stay in jail?{W2}
0915=Give me the jewels.{W1}
0916={NAME;5} searched the tool{N}bag of the Galam Knight.{W1}

0920=Ummm...I can't remove it!{N}Is it cursed?{W2}
0921=We'll go to the church{N}later to see if it's cursed.{N}At least we have it now.{W1}
0922=The knight said that King{N}Galam took the other jewel{N}with him.{W2}
0923={LEADER}, I'll go to{N}Granseal with you.{W1}
0924=I have an obligation to find{N}the other jewel!{W2}
0925=Let's go to Granseal!{W1}

0928=No one is allowed to leave{N}'til we conquer Granseal!{W1}
0929=I know...ah...but...{N}King Galam...left this{N}behind.{W1}

095C=King Galam murmurs a{N}magic spell.{W1}
095D=Watch out!{W1}
095E=What?!{W1}
095F=Father!{W1}
0960=Don't worry...I'm fine.{W1}
0961=That was just a warning!{N}Do you want me to attack{N}again?{W1}
0962=King Granseal...{W2}
0963=Galam, please tell me...{N}What's in this tower?{N}In Ground Seal?{W1}
0964=You really want to know?{N}Ha, ha!  OK, I'll tell you.{W1}

0974=Minister, help me!{W1}
0975=Y...yes...but how?{W1}
0976=Throw {LEADER} towards{N}the light tubes!{W1}
0977={LEADER}, save her!{W1}
0978=Too late.  You're too late.{W1}
0979=Oops, we lost our grip!{N}But...{W1}
097A={LEADER} grasped the{N}Jewel of Evil.{W1}
097B=What are you doing?{W2}
097C=Don't touch my jewel!{N}Don't touch it!{W1}
097D=I said, don't touch it!{W2}

0981=I've almost got you now!{W1}
0982=No, you'll fall if you{N}open your hands now!{W1}

098B=We couldn't help the{N}Princess.{W1}
098C=(Sigh)....{W1}
098D={LEADER}, why do you{N}have two jewels?{W1}
098E={LEADER} explains{N}what happened.{W1}
098F=Indeed, perhaps...these{N}jewels are the key to{N}solving this....{W1}
0990=What?! Another earthquake?{W1}
0991=Wow!  It's getting worse!{W1}
0992=Whoa!{W1}
0993=Sssiirrr Astral!{N}What should we do?!{W1}
0994=I'm not sure.{W1}
0995=Sir Astral!{W1}
0996=Let's get out of here!{W2}
0997=We'll come back later with{N}soldiers to rescue her.{W1}
0998=But, Sir Astral...{W1}

09A7=Huh?  Where is it?{W1}
09A8=It's...humph...{W1}
09A9={LEADER}...how come{N}you're here?{W1}
09AA=What a fool.{N}We came to help you!{W2}
09AB=You would be dead if we{N}hadn't come.{W1}
09AC=What are you talking about?{N}Oh, yeah!  I remember.{W2}
09AD=A huge rock fell on me after{N}you left.{W2}
09AE=It must have knocked me out.{N}Anyway, thank you.{W2}
09AF=Look at that!{N}The tunnel is blocked by{N}a rockslide.{W1}
09B0=Oh, what a pity.{N}Treasures may lie within....{W2}
09B1=I guess we'll never know.{W1}
09B2={LEADER}, let's go back{N}to the ship.{W1}
09B3=You'll come to the foot of{N}Mt. Volcano through this{N}dark cave.{W2}
09B4=But, I heard this cave is{N}home to a hobgoblin.{W1}
09B5=Yes, it is!{W1}
09B6=Wh...Who said that?{W1}
09B7=Me!  The hobgoblin!{W1}
09B8=Welcome to my home.{W2}
09B9=Enjoy your visit because{N}you're not leaving!{W1}
09BA=How can you...defeat...{N}devils?{W1}
09BB=Ah!  You have the Jewel of{N}Evil around your neck.{W2}
09BC=It's you, {LEADER}.{N}We've been waiting for you.{W1}
09BD={LEADER}, did you hear{N}that?  He said, he had{N}been waiting for you.{W2}
09BE=Why do the devils want you?{W1}
09BF={NAME;10}, are you OK?  {NAME;10}!{W1}
09C0=Squawk!  They knocked me{N}senseless.{W1}
09C1=Where are the devils?{N}{LEADER}, did you defeat{N}them?{W2}
09C2=Nobody in Bedoe can fight{N}like that.  Thank you.{W1}
09C3=He's a great fighter.{N}Volcanon doesn't know how{N}good he is!{W1}
09C4=He'll learn.{W2}
09C5=Let's go see the mayor and{N}get a raft!{W1}
09C6={CLEAR}{LEADER} decides to take{N}{NAME;10} the BDMN with him.{W1}{CLEAR}
09C7=This is the Ancient Hall{N}that leads to the Ancient{N}Tunnel...{W1}
09C8=There are more monsters here!{W2}
09C9={LEADER}, take 'em out!{W1}
09CA=It was lucky for me that I{N}met you.  Thank you.{W1}
09CB=Follow me to the Ancient{N}Tunnel.{W1}
09CC=Why is this door closed?{N}That's strange...{W2}
09CD=Oh well, let's go in.{W1}
09CE=What?  Let me try again.{W1}
09CF=Petro, my grandson, locked{N}the door.{W1}
09D0=Sorry, guys!  We can't go to{N}Grans Island this way.{W1}
09D1=Huh?  The raft stopped!{W1}
09D2=Did the water stop flowing?{N}What's happening?{W1}
09D3=Wow!{D1}  What's that?{W1}
09D4={LEADER}, look there!{W1}
09D5=M...{D1}monster!{N}It appeared from the river!{W1}
09D6=It must be the monster they{N}mentioned in Polca.{W2}
09D7=Watch out!{W1}
09D8=Stop!{W1}
09D9=Who IS that big guy?{W1}
09DA=Don't you know?{W1}
09DB=That's Taros.  The guardian of{N}this ancient shrine.{W1}
09DC=Again, stop right there, or{N}I'll attack you.{W1}
09DD=What should we do?{W1}
09DE=The Caravan is there, behind{N}him.  We must have it!{W1}
09DF=Time's up!  Now we battle.{W1}
09E0={LEADER}, you're much{N}stronger than I thought.{W1}
09E1=It's so small.  I'll just{N}try to...get inside....{W1}
09E2=Oh, he's gone!{W1}
09E3=I hope he comes back.{N}Did {NAME;11} lie to us?{W1}
09E4=I never lie!{W1}
09E5=The Ancients were...how{N}should I say this...great!{W1}
09E6=No wonder the Caravan is so{N}small.  It carries miniaturized{N}people and items.{W2}
09E7=I can drive this excellent{N}vehicle.  May I go with you{N}as a driver?{W1}
09E8={NAME;11} the historian{N}tags along with the force.{W1}
09E9=You're kidding, right?{W1}
09EA=Well, at least we can bring{N}a lot of soldiers with us.{W1}
09EB=But soldiers in the Caravan{N}cannot enter battle 'cause{N}they've been miniaturized.{W1}
09EC=We'll just have to see.{W1}
09ED=Humph.  I don't like this guy.{W1}
09EE=I wonder what adventures{N}we'll find with this Caravan!{W1}
09EF=Wait!{W1}
09F0=What's wrong, Oddler?{W1}
09F1={LEADER}...{NAME;7}...can{N}you hear that?{W1}
09F2=Hear what?{W1}
09F3=I don't hear anything.{W1}
09F4=Somebody is crying for help...{W2}
09F5=from...over here.{W1}
09F6=It's coming from this{N}direction.{W1}
09F7=Look!  Over there!{W1}
09F8=Help me!{W1}
09F9=An...elven boy?{N}He's stuck in the pond.{W2}
09FA=He must be very tired.{N}Let's pull him out.{W1}
09FB=Did you come to help me?{N}Oh, thank you!{W2}
09FC=I might have been eaten by{N}monsters if you hadn't come.{W1}
09FD=My dinner is escaping!{W1}
09FE=Who said that?{W1}
09FF=That pond catches my food.{N}Hey elf boy, good trap, huh?{W2}
0A00=Those who get stuck in the{N}pond are mine.  It's my{N}rule.{W1}
0A01=Then, all the missing people{N}were eaten by you?{W1}
0A02=They were in my pond.{W1}
0A03=And this elf is my dinner{N}for tonight.  Got it?{W1}
0A04=Did you guys bring the{N}ketchup? No? Oh, well.{W1}
0A05={LEADER}, we have to{N}save him!{W1}
0A06=I'm {NAME;13}, an archer.{N}I had no idea how dangerous{N}this pond was.{W2}
0A07=You saved my life.{N}Thank you.{W1}
0A08=You should thank Oddler.{W2}
0A09=He heard your cry for help{N}and brought us here.{W1}
0A0A=Oh well, it was nothing.{W1}
0A0B=An elf always returns a{N}favor.{W2}
0A0C=Please, let me help you.{W1}
0A0D={LEADER}, looks like{N}we've found another friend.{W1}
0A0E=Oh, thank you!{W1}
0A0F=Now, let's go see Mr. Creed!{W1}
0A10=(Sniff, sniff)...I smell{N}more invaders from the east.{W2}
0A11=This is the territory of{N}Mr. Creed.{W1}
0A12=Go away!{W1}
0A13=But we have to see him.{W2}
0A14=Please let us pass!{W1}
0A15=No!  Leave now!{W1}
0A16=Never mind.  Get 'em boys!{W1}
0A17=Hurry!  Let's go into{N}Creed's mansion.{W1}
0A18=Oddler, can you see?{W1}
0A19=No, why?{W1}
0A1A=You're moving around as{N}if you can see.{W1}
0A1B=Am I?  Maybe my other{N}senses have sharpened{N}since I lost my sight.{W1}
0A1C=Oh, I see.{W1}
0A1D={LEADER}, let's go see{N}Mr. Creed!{W1}
0A1E=There's a wobbly rock.{W1}
0A1F=That rock looks{N}suspicious....{W1}
0A20=Maybe {NAME;13} can{N}help us.{W1}
0A21=Fairy said, move this rock{N}in this manner, and...{W1}
0A22=Got it!  Thanks, fairy!{W1}
0A23={LEADER}, come on.{W1}
0A24=Answer me!{N}Where are you going?{W1}
0A25=Ah...I...{W1}
0A26=You were going to South{N}Parmecia to get help, right?{W1}
0A27=I...uh...{W1}
0A28=Paladins of Pacalon are{N}cowards!  {NAME;19}, don't{N}you have any pride?{W2}
0A29=Wimp!{W1}
0A2A=Shut up!  Mr. {NAME;19} is{N}the bravest soldier in the{N}world!{W1}
0A2B=I can defend myself.{W1}
0A2C=Come on, you half-breed!{W1}
0A2D=Are you afraid of me?{N}I'll turn my back to you.{N}Now, run away you cowards!{W1}
0A2E=You've gone too far!{W1}
0A2F=Aaaauuuuu!{W1}
0A30=Pacalon soldiers have no{N}honor.  They attack while{N}my back is turned!{W1}
0A31=What?!{W2}
0A32=If Mr. {NAME;19} was not{N}ill, you'd be history!{W1}
0A33=Oh, is {NAME;19} ill?{W1}
0A34=In that case, you can try{N}and take me.{W1}
0A35=I can no longer put up with{N}these insults!{W1}
0A36=No, no!{W1}
0A37=Grruuu....{W1}
0A38=You look so sad,{N}{NAME;19}....{W1}
0A39=You're not just a normal{N}devil soldier.{W1}
0A3A=You're right, {NAME;19}.{N}I see why you're the leader{N}of the Pacalon Army.{W2}
0A3B=I'm Geshp!  An adviser for{N}Zeon!{W1}
0A3C=How did you know my name?{W1}
0A3D=I know everything.{W1}
0A3E=Now, tell me the reason why{N}
0A3F=you're keeping me alive.{W1}
0A40=Ha, ha!  You're smart!{W1}
0A41=What did you do?{W1}
0A42=I...can't...!{N}My body won't...{W1}
0A43=I came here to borrow your{N}body.{W2}
0A44=Ha, ha!  Welcome our new{N}leader!{W1}
0A45=Stop!!!{W1}
0A46=Who said that?{W1}
0A47=A force from the south?{N}How?{W2}
0A48=Where did you come from?{W1}
0A49=We're from Granseal!{W1}
0A4A=But, that's on the other....{W1}
0A4B=I'd better leave...{W2}
0A4C=Devil soldiers!  Stop that{N}force from Granseal!{W1}
0A4D=Is he alright?{W1}
0A4E=We have to save him before{N}he is possessed by an evil...{W1}
0A4F=What happened?{W2}
0A50=Ah...I was almost possessed{N}by that devil.{W1}
0A51=Thank you.{N}How can I repay you for{N}your kindness?{W1}
0A52=Are you OK now?  Good.{W2}
0A53=May I ask you, where were{N}you going in such a wounded{N}state?{W1}
0A54=Pacalon, my country.  We{N}are fighting against the{N}devils.{W2}
0A55=But, no country in North{N}Parmecia has enough power{N}to resist them.{W2}
0A56=So, I was heading south to{N}find some allies.{W1}
0A57=You don't have to go any{N}further.{W1}
0A58=Then, you're from South{N}Parmecia?{W1}
0A59=Yes, Granseal.{W1}
0A5A=Oh, how lucky!  Please{N}come with me to Pacalon!{W1}
0A5B=But, we have to go to{N}Tristan.{W1}
0A5C=Oh, please...I can't return{N}to Pacalon without allies.{W2}
0A5D=Maybe, when you're done...{W2}
0A5E=OK, I'll go with you.{W1}
0A5F=But, you're injured{N}Mr. {NAME;19}.{W1}
0A60=No problem.  I don't know{N}why, but I'm much better.{W1}
0A61=Let's go to Pacalon.{W1}
0A62=Where did you come from?{N}What are you doing here?{W1}
0A63=Don't you know about the{N}restrictions?{W1}
0A64=Even if you didn't know,{N}that's just to bad.{W1}
0A65=Wow, look at that?{W1}
0A66=Those monsters are eating{N}the bridge.{W1}
0A67=Help!  Help me!{W1}
0A68=Look!{W2}
0A69=She's stranded on the{N}bridge.{W1}
0A6A=Get away from the bridge{N}before it falls into the{N}river!{W1}
0A6B=I sprained my ankle!{N}Please help me!{W2}
0A6C=I can't stand up!{W1}
0A6D={LEADER}, defeat all the{N}monsters!  Hurry!{W1}
0A6E=Phew!  That was close!{W1}
0A6F=Thank you very much.{W2}
0A70=Excuse me, will you help{N}me up?{W1}
0A71=NO!  I'll do it!{W1}
0A72=We'll take you with us.{W2}
0A73=Tristan is the nearest town.{N}I think you had better rest{N}there.{W1}
0A74=Thank you, sir.{W1}
0A75=You sure are being nice.{N}Hmmm....{W2}
0A76=Anyway, Tristan is just over{N}there.  Let's go.{W1}
0A77={LEADER}...{NAME;7}...{W1}
0A78=What?  Don't you want to{N}go to Tristan?{W1}
0A79=Oh, I do, but...{W1}
0A7A=We shouldn't go to Tristan{N}right now.{W1}
0A7B=Why not?{W1}
0A7C=Because of me!{W1}
0A7D=Wh...who are you?!{W2}
0A7E=Are you a devil?{W1}
0A7F=I'm one of the leaders of{N}the Devil Army.{N}My name is Cameela!{W1}
0A80=What do you want?{W1}
0A81={LEADER}, I came here{N}to get your Jewel of Evil!{W1}
0A82=Zeon told US to bring it to{N}the Ancient Tower.{N}He didn't mention you.{W2}
0A83=And since we've never heard{N}of you, you're not getting{N}the jewel!{W1}
0A84=No!  His orders were...{W1}
0A85=If Zeon finds out, you will{N}be...{W1}
0A86=He'll forgive me when I{N}bring him the jewel.{W2}
0A87=Enough talking!  Hand over{N}that jewel.  In return, I'll{N}spare Sir Astral!{W2}
0A88=Do you want me to kill this{N}old man?{W1}
0A89=The jewel can't be removed{N}from {LEADER}'s neck.{W2}
0A8A=Do you really think that you{N}can kill me?{W1}
0A8B=Of course.{W1}
0A8C=HA!{W1}
0A8D=Ooops!{W1}
0A8E=Well done.  You dodged my{N}fireball.{W1}
0A8F=What a surprising old wizard!{W2}
0A90=I didn't think I could obtain{N}the jewel that easily.{N}Ha, ha!{W2}
0A91=This is gonna be fun!{N}{LEADER}!{N}Keep it for a while.{W1}
0A92=Wait!{W1}
0A93=Be careful of Geshp and{N}Zalbard!{W1}
0A94=Ah, she's gone....{N}OK, {LEADER}.{N}Let's go to Tristan.{W1}
0A95=Would you please explain{N}what just happened?{W1}
0A96=You don't know?{W2}
0A97=Everything here was set up{N}by Cameela.{W2}
0A98=It was a trap to get the{N}Jewel of Evil.{W1}
0A99=Your fireball...as if you{N}knew what she was from the{N}beginning.{W1}
0A9A=Yes, I did.{W2}
0A9B=Her evil aura was apparent.{N}By the way, did you hear{N}what she said?{W2}
0A9C=They're all acting on their{N}own, ignoring Zeon's orders.{W2}
0A9D=It will be dangerous.{N}We must be careful.{W1}
0A9E=You can't enter Mitula's{N}Shrine now.{W1}
0A9F=Sir Astral, what do we do{N}now?{W1}
0AA0=Hmmm....{W1}
0AA1={LEADER}, what do you{N}think?{W1}
0AA2=I'm not sure.{W1}
0AA3={LEADER}, it's obvious!{W1}
0AA4=I agree.  We have to see the{N}storytellers and listen to{N}the legends.{W2}
0AA5=Make a break for it!{W1}
0AA6=Wait, wait.  You must not{N}enter the holy shrine.{W2}
0AA7=So be it!  Let the truth be{N}known!{W1}
0AA8=Go away!  The devils already{N}occupy this shrine!{W1}
0AA9=Devils again!{W2}
0AAA={LEADER}, attack!{W1}
0AAB=Welcome, Granseal force!{W1}
0AAC=What?{W1}
0AAD=I heard a voice from the{N}other side of the door.{W1}
0AAE=I'm Zalbard.  I'm one of{N}the greater devils.{W1}
0AAF=Do come in.  Of course, you{N}can go back now and abandon{N}Mitula!{W1}
0AB0=Sir Astral...{W2}
0AB1=The greater devil that{N}attacked Bedoe was as{N}strong as Volcanon.{W1}
0AB2=Are you talking about{N}Sir Odd Eye?{W2}
0AB3=Did he fight against{N}Volcanon at Bedoe?{W1}
0AB4=Yes.  And he lost.{W1}
0AB5=I can't believe it!{N}Odd Eye is the strongest{N}devil among us.{W2}
0AB6=But, we haven't been able to{N}contact him lately.{W2}
0AB7=This is good news for me.{N}If I get the Jewel of Evil, I{N}can take his place.{W2}
0AB8=Now, enter the shrine.{N}Mitula is here.{W1}
0AB9=What should we do?{N}A greater devil awaits us{N}inside.{W1}
0ABA=Odd Eye...Odd Eye...{N}Odd...Eye....{W1}
0ABB=Sir Astral?{W1}
0ABC=I think I've heard that{N}name before....{W1}
0ABD=Sir Astral?{W1}
0ABE=Hmmmm....{W1}
0ABF=Sir Astral!!!{W1}
0AC0=Whhhhhhat?{N}{NAME;7}, don't scare me!{W1}
0AC1=What's wrong with you?{W2}
0AC2=Should we go into the shrine{N}now?{W1}
0AC3=Oh, sorry.{W1}
0AC4=Zalbard...at least he's not{N}as strong as Odd Eye.{W2}
0AC5=But still, he's a greater{N}devil.{W2}
0AC6=We had better complete our{N}preparations before we go in.{W1}
0AC7=OK.{W1}
0AC8=What a pleasure!{N}Nice to meet you.{W1}
0AC9=Ohhh....{N}He's ugly, isn't he?{W1}
0ACA=What?!{N}You dare insult me?!{W2}
0ACB=I've never...{N}For that you will die!{W1}
0ACC=Are you ready to die?{W1}
0ACD=Grrr...impossible!{N}Why...do I have to die?{W1}
0ACE=Where is Mitula?{W1}
0ACF=I don't know...haven't{N}seen her.{W1}
0AD0=Oops!  The Ground Orb....{W1}
0AD1=I can't endure the light....{N}Ohhh....{W1}
0AD2=Thanks to the Ground Orb, we{N}finally defeated Zalbard.{W2}
0AD3=The orb released holy power{N}in it's light.{W1}
0AD4=Hey, look over there!{W1}
0AD5=Welcome!{W1}
0AD6=Thank you.{W2}
0AD7=I've finally returned to this{N}world.{W1}
0AD8=Goddess Mitula?{W1}
0AD9=Oh, nice to meet you,{N}Sir Astral.{W1}
0ADA=Oh, you know my name?{N}Gee....{W2}
0ADB=Please tell us, what should{N}we do now?{W1}
0ADC=I don't know.{W1}
0ADD=What?!{W2}
0ADE=But, why?  You're a goddess.{N}You know our future, right?{W1}
0ADF=I'm not Volcanon.  I never{N}tell people the future, even{N}if it could prevent death.{W1}
0AE0=Death?!  Not ours I hope.{W1}
0AE1=Zeon is an unimaginably{N}strong devil.{W2}
0AE2=If he attains full power,{N}I, even Volcanon, would not{N}be able to stop him.{W1}
0AE3=So, we have to defeat him{N}before he revives completely.{W1}
0AE4=His power is sealed in the{N}Jewel of Evil.{W1}
0AE5=So, that's why he wants the{N}jewel!{W1}
0AE6=Then, why don't we keep the{N}jewel forever.{W1}
0AE7=Arc Valley is the place where{N}evil power gathers.{W2}
0AE8=He will recover his power{N}if he stays there long enough.{W1}
0AE9=Did you say, Arc Valley?{W1}
0AEA=You call it Ancient Tower{N}or Granseal.{W2}
0AEB=Granseal is named for the{N}symbol in the tower.{N}It seals the ground.{W1}
0AEC=I see.{W1}
0AED=Goddess Mitula, where are{N}you going?{W1}
0AEE=Down to the surface.{N}To save the people.{W1}
0AEF=Are you going to abandon us,{N}as Volcanon did?{W1}
0AF0=Well...no.{N}I'll give you a hint.{W2}
0AF1=Listen to the legends from{N}the storytellers before you{N}go to Grans Island.{W1}
0AF2=You can't kill Zeon, but{N}Volcanon and I will help you{N}if you weaken him.{W2}
0AF3={LEADER}!{N}You are the chosen one.{N}You have the holy jewel.{W2}
0AF4=We need your help to reseal{N}Zeon.{N}Find the holy sword.{W1}
0AF5=Where is it?{N}How can we find it?{W1}
0AF6=It's on Grans.{N}Your jewel will lead you to...{W1}
0AF7=Mitula, Mitula!!{W1}
0AF8={LEADER}, Mitula{N}has vanished!{N}What should we do now?{W1}
0AF9=We have to go to Arc Valley{N}on Grans Island.{W2}
0AFA={LEADER}, find the{N}storytellers first.{W1}
0AFB=Finally, you've left the{N}castle, Vicar {NAME;22}.{W1}
0AFC=Geshp!{W1}
0AFD=So, you remember me. {W1}
0AFE=What do you want?{W1}
0AFF=I have plans for you.{W2}
0B00=I'm very happy that you came{N}out of the castle.{W1}
0B01=Why?{W1}
0B02=I have been waiting for{N}{NAME;22}.{W2}
0B03=Vicar {NAME;22}, you locked{N}the gate of Moun, remember?{W2}
0B04=My faithful soldiers can't{N}enter Parmecia.{N}Now, you will open it!{W1}
0B05=It's a trap!{W2}
0B06={NAME;22}, run!{W1}
0B07=Ha, ha.  He can't.{W1}
0B08=Cameela!  Cameeeeeela!{W1}
0B09=Cameela?!  We met her in{N}Pangoat Valley.{W1}
0B0A=What?{W1}
0B0B=Ah, Cameela.  You're here.{W2}
0B0C=Get the key for me!{W1}
0B0D=Geshp, you're as devious as{N}usual.{W1}
0B0E=That I am.  Now, get the key!{W1}
0B0F=Me?!  Why?{W1}
0B10=Cameela!{W1}
0B11=I hate you!{N}I won't help you.{W2}
0B12=You want the key?{N}You get it!{N}You can use my army.{W2}
0B13=See you later.{W1}
0B14=That witch!{W2}
0B15=Cameela!  Cameela!!{W1}
0B16=They're divided....{W1}
0B17=I don't need your help,{N}Cameela!{W2}
0B18=Come on, devils!{N}Kill {LEADER} now!{W1}
0B19=Bye, {LEADER}.{W1}
0B1A=You're not staying?{W1}
0B1B=I'm good at using my brains,{N}not my strength.{W2}
0B1C=I'll return by the time{N}you're defeated.{W1}
0B1D=I heard about you from{N}Geshp.{W1}
0B1E=He ordered me to take out{N}some of your people.{W2}
0B1F=But, it's not enough.{N}This is the end of your{N}resistance.{W1}
0B20=Kill them, kill them all!{W1}
0B21=I'm tired of this.  I can no{N}longer fight for devils.{W1}
0B22={NAME;23}, what?{W1}
0B23=Didn't you hear me?{W1}
0B24=Hey, Granseal guys!{N}I'm on your side from now{N}on! OK?{W1}
0B25=I can't believe it!{N}You might have been killed{N}by the devils.{W1}
0B26=Indeed!  Why did you{N}change your mind?{W1}
0B27=I'm {NAME;23}, from Galam.{N}I was waiting for the chance{N}to escape from them.{W2}
0B28=I can't stand their wicked{N}ways!{W1}
0B29=You have the same opinion{N}of them as we do.{W1}
0B2A=Please let me join you!{N}I could be a great help to{N}you.{W2}
0B2B=You need a professional{N}soldier like me.{W1}
0B2C=Oh, we welcome you.{W1}
0B2D=But, he was on the other{N}side just an minute ago.{W1}
0B2E=I don't care, {NAME;7}.{N}He has seen the error of his{N}ways.{W1}
0B2F={LEADER}, don't you want{N}{NAME;23} to join our{N}force?{W1}
0B30=Oh, thank you!{W2}
0B31=I'll try to do my best!{W1}
0B32=I'm opening the gate of Moun.{N}Devils are waiting inside.{N}Be careful!{W1}
0B33=Vicar {NAME;22} uses{N}the gate key.{W1}
0B34=Welcome, losers!{W2}
0B35=Will you follow the example{N}of the people of Moun and die{N}without resistance?{W1}
0B36=No!  I'm too late.{N}I killed a lot of people.{W2}
0B37=I can never forgive myself!{W1}
0B38={LEADER}, please let me{N}fight with you.  They must{N}die!{W1}
0B39={LEADER}, {NAME;22} will be{N}a great asset.{W1}
0B3A={NAME} returns to the{N}Caravan.{W1}
0B3B={LEADER}, {NAME;22} is{N}right.  They must die!{W1}
0B3C=There may be some survivors{N}somewhere.{W1}
0B3D=Do not touch my rock!{W1}
0B3E=Did you defeat all those{N}devils?{W2}
0B3F=I was wondering why it became{N}quiet so suddenly.{W1}
0B40=Are you a survivor?{N}Are you from Moun?{N}What's your name?{W1}
0B41=I am {NAME;26}.{N}I am not from Moun.{W1}
0B42=Then, where are you from?{W1}
0B43=The past.{W1}
0B44=What do you mean?{W1}
0B45=I cannot explain.{W2}
0B46=I am what I am.{N}That is all that I am.{W1}
0B47=I've never seen anyone like{N}you.{W2}
0B48=Where are the people of{N}Moun?  Were there any{N}survivors?{W1}
0B49=Some.{W1}
0B4A=That's good news.{W2}
0B4B=And where are they?{W1}
0B4C=Down here.  Follow me.{W1}
0B4D={LEADER}, hurry!{N}Follow {NAME;26}!{W2}
0B4E={NAME;26} knows where{N}they're hiding.{W1}
0B4F=Hello, Granseal soldiers.{W1}
0B50=Remember?  I promised that I{N}would see you again.{W2}
0B51=Come on.  Let's party!{W1}
0B52=Stop!  You need my war plan!{W1}
0B53=You again, Geshp?  Why don't{N}you leave me alone?{W1}
0B54=Zeon left me in charge.{W2}
0B55=It doesn't matter if you are{N}killed or not.{W1}
0B56=Then kill me, if you've{N}got the guts to do it!{W2}
0B57=I know.  You want me to be{N}die!{W1}
0B58=Geshp, you coward!{N}I'll kill you first!{W1}
0B59=I have no time to waste.{N}I must go.{W2}
0B5A=Silly Cameela.{N}You can't survive without my{N}brains.{W1}
0B5B={LEADER}, did you hear that?{N}He said you would win!{W2}
0B5C=He must be a bad{N}fortuneteller.{W1}
0B5D=We can get a ship and return{N}to Grans if we defeat her.{W2}
0B5E={LEADER}, get her!{W1}
0B5F={LEADER}, I lost?!{N}Take this.{W1}
0B60=Cameela reveals the Sky Orb.{W1}
0B61=This is the Sky Orb.  With{N}it, you can drive the Nazca{N}Ship.{W2}
0B62=Listen.  You have to be very{N}careful from now on.{W2}
0B63=Geshp has Prism Flowers.{N}He will...{W1}
0B64=Your life is over,{N}Cameela!{W1}
0B65=Geshp!{W1}
0B66=Ha, ha, ha!  You acted just{N}as I planned!{W1}
0B67=Ouuuuu...Ges...{W1}
0B68=How horrible!{W1}
0B69=It's the law.  Traitors{N}die by fire.{W2}
0B6A=Congratulations!{N}You have a ship now!{N}Come to Grans!{W2}
0B6B=I have to go now and{N}prepare your welcoming{N}party!{W1}
0B6C=I really hate him!{W2}
0B6D=Prism Flowers?{N}What are they?{W1}
0B6E=I have no idea, but it's{N}probably a trap.{W1}
0B6F=Ancient flower.{W1}
0B70=Excuse me?{W1}
0B71=Ancient countries had those{N}flowers along their borders.{W1}
0B72=What kind of flowers are{N}they?{W1}
0B73=I cannot explain....{W1}
0B74=We will see them when we{N}arrive at Grans.{W1}
0B75={LEADER}, grab the Sky{N}Orb.{N}Let's go.{W1}
0B76=You're still alive?{W1}
0B77=Geshp!{W1}
0B78=Unbelievable!{N}You really are persistent.{W1}
0B79=We'll never stop!{W2}
0B7A=We will not die until we{N}destroy all of you.{W1}
0B7B={LEADER}, kill him!{W2}
0B7C=We have to kill him now!{W1}
0B7D=I'm very sorry, but I have{N}to go.{W1}
0B7E=Don't let them advance!{W1}
0B7F=He escaped again!{W1}
0B80=Geshp sure is a tricky{N}devil.{W2}
0B81=After him, now!{W1}
0B82=You're early!{N}{W2}
0B83=Darn you, Granseal swine!{W2}
0B84=But, don't worry.  I just{N}finished my preparations.{N}Yes...everything's ready.{W2}
0B85=It's show time!{W1}
0B86=Sir Astral, why is he smiling?{W1}
0B87=He believes this is the place{N}where we will die....{W1}
0B88={LEADER}, be careful!{W1}
0B89=Prism Flowers?{W2}
0B8A=My Prism Flowers!{W1}
0B8B={LEADER}, I shall return{N}with Red Baron!{N}You'll pay for this!{W1}
0B8C=Now you shall pay for killing{N}my precious Prism Flowers.{W1}
0B8D=Geshp again.{W1}
0B8E=Hee, hee, hee.{W1}
0B8F=Do you have another cunning{N}trap for us?{W1}
0B90=Would I do that?{W2}
0B91=I just want to introduce you{N}to my friend.{W1}
0B92=Red Baron, say hello!{W1}
0B93=Grruuooouu!{W1}
0B94=He's waiting for you just{N}outside the Galam gate.{W2}
0B95=You have to defeat him if you{N}want to advance.{W2}
0B96=See his red armor?{N}It's smeared with blood.{W2}
0B97=He has killed many people.{W1}
0B98=Now, it's your turn.{W2}
0B99=This will be your undoing.{W1}
0B9A=Galam is just over there,{N}but...{W1}
0B9B=We have to advance.{N}{LEADER}, are you ready?{W1}
0B9C=Sir Astral, he's...crying!{W1}
0B9D=Why would he be crying?{W1}
0B9E=I think I've seen his style{N}of fighting before.{N}Let's see his face.{W1}
0B9F=Astral removes the mask.{W1}
0BA0=Huh?{W1}
0BA1=It's {NAME;28}!{W1}
0BA2=Let me see him.{W1}
0BA3=Wow, he's alive!{W1}
0BA4={NAME;28}!  {NAME;28}!{W1}
0BA5=Where?!{W1}
0BA6=What?!{W1}
0BA7=Oh, Sir Astral!  I had an{N}awful nightmare.{W2}
0BA8=I was controlled by someone{N}and I killed a lot of...{W1}
0BA9=It wasn't a dream.{W1}
0BAA=What?!{W1}
0BAB=You were being controlled{N}by a devil.{W2}
0BAC=And he made you kill every{N}person you saw.{W2}
0BAD=You recovered your senses{N}when we defeated the devils.{W1}
0BAE=I can't believe it!{N}I'm {NAME;28}, I'm...{W1}
0BAF=What can I do?{N}How can I atone for my sins?{W1}
0BB0=Sir Astral, tell me.{W1}
0BB1=You're not at fault.{W1}
0BB2=It's not your fault.{N}The devils are to blame.{W1}
0BB3=But...{W1}
0BB4=I have to die for my sins.{N}It will be my atonement.{W2}
0BB5=I have to die!{W1}
0BB6=Oh, poor {NAME;28}.{W1}
0BB7=Sir Astral, {NAME;28} has{N}fled. {W2}
0BB8=Will you let him die?{W1}
0BB9={NAME;28} is an immortal{N}vampire now.  He can't die{N}very easily.{W1}
0BBA=I think we'll meet him again.{N}{LEADER}, let's go.{W1}
0BBB=Stop!{W1}
0BBC=Finally, you've arrived.{W2}
0BBD=It was a mistake to{N}underestimate you.{W2}
0BBE=But, the game is not over.{N}At the risk of my life,{N}you'll proceed no further!{W1}
0BBF=Geshp is serious.{N}He finally considers us{N}worthy opponents.{W2}
0BC0={LEADER}, be careful.{N}We mustn't underrate his{N}power.{W1}
0BC1=You're right, Astral!{W2}
0BC2=Zeon doesn't trust me,{N}thanks to you!{W2}
0BC3=This is my last chance.{N}I can't see him again 'til I{N}bring him your head.{W1}
0BC4=My traps...{W1}
0BC5=I'm...at the end of my rope.{N}I...must...escape.{W1}
0BC6=Nooooooo!{W1}
0BC7=Please...please let me go.{W1}
0BC8=We don't want to kill{N}you.{N}You've lost your powers.{W1}
0BC9=I know...(sob, sob)....{W1}
0BCA=You may go.{W1}
0BCB=Thank you.{W1}
0BCC=I won't forget this.{W1}
0BCD=Where are you going, Geshp?{W1}
0BCE=Do you remember your vow?{W1}
0BCF=You failed to get the jewel{N}from {LEADER}.{W2}
0BD0=Now, you will pay with your{N}life.{W1}
0BD1=No, please...NO!{W1}
0BD2=Zeon is such an unfeeling{N}devil...(shiver).{W1}
0BD3=He will do the same to us{N}if we lose to him.{W1}
0BD4=We must not be defeated.{W1}
0BD5=I just heard that Geshp{N}lost.{W2}
0BD6=All greater devils have been{N}defeated except for Odd Eye.{W1}
0BD7=This is a good chance for us{N}to become greater devils!{W2}
0BD8=I'm sure Zeon will promote{N}us if we can get the jewel.{W1}
0BD9=Look over there!{W1}
0BDA=They're coming!{W1}
0BDB=Excellent!{N}Welcome to your graveyard!{W1}
0BDC={LEADER}, you're finally{N}here.{W1}
0BDD=Is that...?{W1}
0BDE=Did you forget about me,{N}{LEADER} and {NAME;7}!{W1}
0BDF=Oddler, are you Odd Eye?{N}Zalbard said...{W1}
0BE0=Yes, I am he.{W1}
0BE1=You're the leader of the Devil{N}Army who attacked Bedoe...{W1}
0BE2=Yes I am, Sir Astral.{W1}
0BE3=How do you know me?{W1}
0BE4={LEADER} told me about{N}you repeatedly.{W1}
0BE5=What do YOU want?{W1}
0BE6=Don't talk to me like that.{N}I'm very sad.{W1}
0BE7=Sad?{N}You've got to be joking!{W1}
0BE8=Well, yes I am.{N}I'm really quite evil.{W1}
0BE9=Don't you think so, Red{N}Baron?{W1}
0BEA=Uhh...(shiver).{W1}
0BEB=Anyway, I came here to{N}deliver an ultimatum.{W2}
0BEC=Think long and well before{N}answering me.{W2}
0BED=Leave the jewel, your{N}weapons, and your items{N}here...or DIE!{W1}
0BEE=That means...we don't have{N}to fight him.{W1}
0BEF=True, but we can't take the{N}easy way out.  We mustn't{N}give him the jewel.{W1}
0BF0=You know how strong I am.{N}I think you had better{N}accept the offer.{W1}
0BF1=Hmmm....{W1}
0BF2=Oh, what should we do?!{W1}
0BF3=We have to fight!{W1}
0BF4=Times up!  We need space{N}to battle.{W1}
0BF5=I'm very sorry, {LEADER},{N}but I must kill you!{W1}
0BF6={LEADER}, are we really{N}going to fight Oddler?{W1}

0C42=I...I never...!{W1}
0C43={LEADER}, we had better{N}run away and return later.{W1}
0C44=Sir Astral, we can't!{W1}
0C45=Why not?{W1}
0C46=Princess Elis fainted when{N}she saw Zeon.{W1}
0C47=What?  Oh, my.{W1}
0C48=And now we're surrounded{N}by devils.{W1}
0C49={LEADER}, believe in your{N}sword and the jewel!{N}We must fight Zeon now!{W1}
0C4A=Let's go!{W1}
0C4B=Devils?{W2}
0C4C=They can't enter the shrine.{W1}
0C4D=This is a sacred area.{W2}
0C4E=Volcanon's shrine is here.{W1}

0C57=I've brought a friend.{W1}
0C58=This is {LEADER}.{N}He's from Granseal.{W1}
0C59=Granseal!{W1}

0C5B=Volcanon?{W1}
0C5C=They awakened Zeon, the{N}legendary devil!{W2}
0C5D=I've been protecting all the{N}ground-dwelling people.{W2}
0C5E=I can't forgive them for{N}this!{W1}
0C5F=Volcanon, please calm down!{W2}
0C60={LEADER} is not the person{N}who did it!{W1}
0C61=Everybody who lives on the{N}ground is responsibile.{W2}
0C62=They have to solve this by{N}themselves.{W1}
0C63=What should {LEADER} do?{W1}
0C64=My protection ceases now!{W2}
0C65=He must face the devils on{N}his own.{W1}
0C66=But...{W2}
0C67=Even the greater devils{N}are as strong as you!{W1}
0C68=If all the humans are{N}annihilated, that's OK.{N}It's their destiny.{W2}
0C69=I want them to show me{N}courage.{W2}
0C6A=They must reseal the devil{N}again.{W1}

0C6C={LEADER}, believe in the{N}power of the jewel.{W2}
0C6D=It belongs to both the{N}light and the darkness.{W2}
0C6E=It shows its true power{N}when the light and the{N}darkness are as one.{W2}
0C6F=You may go now.  I don't{N}want to see anybody until{N}Zeon is defeated.{W1}
0C70=Volcanon!{W1}
0C71={LEADER}, we'll defeat{N}that devil by ourselves!{W1}
0C72=I didn't know he was such a{N}cold-hearted god.{W2}
0C73=OK, I'll help you!  I'll{N}go with you to reseal the{N}devil!{W1}
0C74=This shrine was built on top{N}of the mountain to watch{N}over everything.{W1}
0C75=Do you know the legend{N}of the phoenix?{W1}
0C76=And {NAME;7} was born from{N}holy fire.{W2}
0C77=Volcanon is the highest{N}of gods and can revive{N}anything.{W2}
0C78=Phoenix serve and work for{N}him.{N}They help the people.{W1}
0C79=A phoenix is the legendary{N}bird who can't be killed.{W2}

0C7B=When his first life is{N}nearly over, he bursts into{N}holy fire to finish it.{W2}
0C7C=The fire creates another{N}life for the phoenix on the{N}ground.{W1}
0C7D=Stop!{W1}
0C7E=Who said that?{W1}
0C7F=Wow, what a huge guy!{W1}
0C80=Leave here!{N}I'll attack you if you don't!{W1}

0C98=The barrier around Grans{N}Island is too strong.{N}I can't see anything.{W1}
0C99=Please try again!{W1}
0C9A=If I touch something of his,{N}maybe I could contact his{N}mind better....{W1}
0C9B={LEADER}, you have the{N}Jewel of Evil, right?{W1}
0C9C=Is this true, {LEADER}?{W2}
0C9D=That's one of the magic{N}jewels used to seal{N}Zeon.  Give it to me.{W1}
0C9E=But, we can't remove it.{W1}
0C9F=I can.{W1}
0CA0=Let me see it.{W1}
0CA1=Whhoooa!{W2}
0CA2=What's that light?{N}There are two!{W1}
0CA3=The other one is...{N}...ahhh...they called it,{N}the Jewel of Light.{W1}
0CA4=What?!{W2}
0CA5={LEADER}, do you have both{N}of the legendary jewels?{W2}
0CA6=I can't remove them.{N}The chain is made of Mithril.{W2}
0CA7=Show them to him.{N}They might help him.{W1}
0CA8={LEADER} displays the{N}jewels to Evil Spirit.{W1}

0CB1=Something has happened to{N}Mitula....{W1}
0CB2=I can't see Zeon.{W1}
0CB3=What do you mean?{W1}
0CB4=He's still in Arc Valley.{W2}
0CB5=He has revived, but he has{N}not recovered his full{N}strength yet.{W1}
0CB6=But, he has already created{N}
0CB7=a lot of mischief on the{N}ground...{W2}
0CB8=Is he that powerful?{W1}
0CB9=He is.{N}His power...{W1}
0CBA=His power what?{W1}

0CC6=Come to Arc Valley...{N}Ggggooo...!{W1}
0CC7=No!  Evil Spirit exploded!{W2}
0CC8=That's Zeon's power.{W2}
0CC9=If he revives fully, his{N}power will be unimaginably{N}strong!{W1}
0CCA=Creed, how reliable was he,{N}I mean, Evil Spirit?{W1}
0CCB=Very.{W2}

0CD3=They must have done something{N}to Goddess Mitula!{W1}
0CD4=Brave Pacaloners?{W2}

0CD6=Devils are coming to town?{N}OK, I'll beat them up!{W1}
0CD7=Oh, I can't.  I'm too hungry!{W1}

0CDB=Devils came to Pacalon{N}through Moun.{W2}
0CDC=We blocked the invaders{N}by locking the gate of Moun.{W2}
0CDD=That means, we abandoned{N}the people living there.{W1}
0CDE=We don't have enough food{N}because of the long drought.{W2}
0CDF=Just one rainfall would make{N}us happy.{W1}
0CE0={NAME;19} asked you to drop{N}by here?  Thank you!{W2}
0CE1=May I ask you a favor?{N}Please save Mitula.{N}She's in Tristan.{W2}
0CE2=We will be ruined by the{N}drought long before the{N}devils destroy us.{W1}
0CE3=You'll see a route through{N}the mountains when you go{N}north from here.{W2}

0CF1=I'm no longer thirsty,{N}but I'm not totally healthy{N}yet.{W1}
0CF2=Practice!  Who needs{N}practice?!  Ha!{W2}

0CF4=I just saw a warrior who{N}came from the south a year{N}ago.{W2}
0CF5=He was shocked to find out{N}that the tunnel was blocked,{N}and went to Moun.{W1}
0CF6=Thank you, strangers!{N}You saved us!{W2}
0CF7=But I didn't think we would{N}be saved by humans!{W1}
0CF8=The King is a little upset.{W2}
0CF9=We've always believed that{N}centaurs were the best{N}warriors.{W2}
0CFA=But we were wrong.{N}I understand now.{W1}
0CFB=You defeated Zalbard and{N}saved Mitula.{W2}
0CFC=You are trustworthy{N}soldiers, so...would you{N}do me a favor?{W2}
0CFD=Please go to Moun with me.{W1}
0CFE=What are you going to do{N}there?{W1}

0D1D=What?!  You forgot to bring{N}the {ITEM} with you?{N}{LEADER}, are you serious?{W2}
0D1E=You fool!  Go back and{N}bring it here!{W1}
0D1F=Ouch!  Hey, {NAME;26}!{N}I like your wild driving!{W2}

0D29=I'll go first.{W1}
0D2A=We must finish our{N}preparations before Geshp{N}finds us.{W1}
0D2B=What a terrible waste.{N}We've lost an ancient{N}treasure.{W2}
0D2C=Anyway, we have to go to{N}Arc Valley.{N}{LEADER}, let's go.{W1}
0D2D={LEADER} tries to use{N}the {ITEM}.{W2}{N}But, he doesn't know how.{W1}
0D2E=Well, {LEADER}.  Let's go{N}back to look for someone{N}who knows about this ship.{W1}
0D2F={LEADER} fit the {ITEM}{N}into the cockpit.{W1}
0D30=You can start the ship by{N}placing the Sky Orb into{N}the cockpit.{W1}
0D31=Wow, the ship is vibrating!{W1}
0D32=What's going on?{W1}
0D33=Don't worry. {W1}

0D3D=Hey, there's {NAME;28}.{W1}
0D3E=I've killed a lot of people{N}for the devils!{W2}
0D3F=The guilt is too much to{N}handle.  I must die!{W1}
0D40=Gee!{N}{NAME;28} killed himself!{W1}
0D41=No, {NAME;28} cannot die{N}by jumping off a cliff.{W2}
0D42={NAME;28} is an immortal{N}vampire.{W2}
0D43=But, I'm sure the impact{N}didn't feel too good.{W1}
0D44=Ah, devils finally found the{N}hidden door.{W1}
0D45=I must give the people time{N}to escape!{W1}
0D46=The priest pulls out a holy{N}symbol.{W1}
0D47=What's he doing?{W1}
0D48=He's mistaking us for devils.{W1}
0D49=What tough devils!{W2}
0D4A=My symbol doesn't drive{N}them away!{W1}
0D4B=Excuse me, we're not devils.{W1}
0D4C=I don't believe you!{W1}
0D4D=But we really...{W1}
0D4E=Brother?{W1}
0D4F={NAME;27}, they found the{N}hidden door!{W2}
0D50=I tried to drive them away{N}with this holy symbol, but{N}I failed.{W1}
0D51=Then, they're not devils.{W1}
0D52=Nobody but devils ever come{N}to such a dangerous place!{N}They must be devils!{W1}
0D53=Have you asked them?{W1}
0D54=How can we explain this?{W2}
0D55=We are from Granseal.{N}We came here to defeat the{N}devils.{W1}
0D56=Granseal?{W1}
0D57=Really?{W1}
0D58=Alright!{W1}
0D59=This is great news!{W1}
0D5A=Are you Sir Astral?{W1}
0D5B=Yes, but...I'm sorry, have{N}we met?{W1}
0D5C=I'm {NAME;27}, a son of{N}Hawel.{W2}
0D5D=Do you remember me?{W1}
0D5E=Hawel's son?{W1}
0D5F=Oh, {NAME;27}!{W2}
0D60=Yes, of course.{N}Nice to see you again.{W2}
0D61=What are you doing here?{W1}
0D62=I came back to Yeel to{N}continue my father's work.{W1}
0D63={NAME;27}, maybe you can{N}answer some questions?{W1}
0D64=I'll try.{W2}
0D65=What would you like to know?{W1}
0D66=Oh, this will be a great{N}help!{W1}
0D67=You can use the room below.{W1}
0D68=Thank you very much.{W1}
0D69=I really appreciate this.{W1}
0D6A=I heard you're going to{N}defeat the devils....{W1}
0D6B=Yep.  {LEADER} just{N}solved the secret.  We{N}can now enter the tower.{W1}
0D6C=The tower?{W2}
0D6D=Then, all these disasters{N}were caused by Zeon?{W1}
0D6E=Let me help you.{W1}
0D6F=I would like to give you{N}a hand.{W1}
0D70=Oh, thank you.{W1}
0D71=I appreciate your kindness.{W1}
0D72=...and now we're here.{W1}
0D73=Wow!  Your story is so{N}complicated.{W2}
0D74=But, from what I understand,{N}Zeon is reviving.{W2}
0D75=And all these disasters were{N}caused by him?{W1}
0D76=That's right.  We have to{N}find out where the Holy{N}Sword is.{W1}
0D77=I think I've seen it in a{N}book....{W2}
0D78=Yes, I did...but...{N}I don't remember....{W1}
0D79=It's important...{W1}
0D7A=Please, give me a moment.{W1}
0D7B=Was it this one?{W1}
0D7C=No, that's not it.{W1}
0D7D=How about this one?{W1}
0D7E=Yeah, I got it!{W1}
0D7F=Is that the right one?{W1}
0D80=Yes!  But...{W1}
0D81=But what?{W1}
0D82=The most important part is{N}missing.  It's been stolen.{W1}
0D83=Who could've taken it?{W2}
0D84=Oh, we've lost the key.{W1}
0D85=Not necessarily, Sir Astral.{W2}
0D86=Believe in {LEADER}.{N}He was chosen by the gods.{W1}
0D87=Hmmm....{W2}
0D88=Yes, {NAME;7} is right.{N}{LEADER} is our leader!{W1}
0D89={LEADER}, we have to{N}find the Holy Sword and{N}the door to the tower.{W2}
0D8A=The legends only hint of{N}you, but we believe in you.{W1}
0D8B=Believe in the power of{N}your jewel!{W1}
0D8C=Yes, that's the truth.{W1}
0D8D=Now, {LEADER}.{W1}
0D8E=We need to return and{N}restore world peace.{W1}
0D8F={LEADER}, would you mind{N}if I went with you?{W1}
0D90=No, {NAME;27}.  You have{N}to continue your work.{W1}
0D91=I knew you'd say that, but I{N}can't continue my work if{N}Zeon revives.{W2}
0D92=Also, as a historian, I{N}want to see the King of{N}the Devils.{W1}
0D93={NAME;27} will just follow{N}us if you don't let him{N}join us.{W1}
0D94={NAME;7} is right.{W1}
0D95=(Sigh)...OK.{W1}
0D96=I'm so excited!{W1}
0D97=This is not a sight-seeing{N}tour, OK?!{N}Let's go {LEADER}!{W1}
0D98=It's a fine-looking piano.{N}Will you play it?{W1}
0D99=Something opened somewhere.{W1}
0D9A={LEADER}, can't you play?{W1}
0D9B=I can't believe it!{N}I want to die, but I can't!{W1}
0D9C=A poster...{N}PULL IT!  PUSH IT!{W1}
0D9D=A book...{N}ANCIENT KINGDOMS{W1}
0D9E=A book...{N}CIVILIZATIONS{W1}
0D9F=A book...{N}THE ANCIENT TOWER{W1}
0DA0=Red Baron is {NAME;28}.{W2}
0DA1=He was running around and{N}crying for somebody to kill{N}him.{W1}
0DA2={NAME;28} went south.{N}He was acting strange.{W1}
0DA3=King Galam has not returned{N}from the war against{N}Granseal.{W1}
0DA4={NAME;28} made that hole.{W2}
0DA5=He jumped off the top of the{N}castle, but he didn't die!{W1}
0DA6=My boyfriend has not{N}returned from the war...{W2}
0DA7=I hope he's alive...{W1}
0DA8=I heard from a soldier that{N}Yeel is haunted.{W2}
0DA9=He said that he heard the{N}sound of a piano playing.{W1}
0DAA=From Granseal?  I didn't{N}know anyone survived that{N}earthquake.{W1}
0DAB=The priest of Yeel liked the{N}piano.  The ghost may be him.{W1}
0DAC=Do you know about the stautue{N}of the devil?  It appeared{N}at the Ancient Tower.{W1}
0DAD=Red Baron was looking for{N}something at the Ancient{N}Tower.{W2}
0DAE=Nobody returned from that{N}trip.  I didn't go. I was{N}smart!{W1}
0DAF=I think he was looking for{N}the Holy Sword.{W2}
0DB0=Please don't tell anybody{N}that I told you.{W1}
0DB1=I...I saw them...many devils{N}came from the tower....{W1}
0DB2=Why am I guarding the{N}kitchen?!{W1}
0DB3=You want to enter the tower?{W2}
0DB4=Impossible.  It's buried in{N}the ground and there is no{N}door.{W1}
0DB5=I heard a rumor that a{N}handsome boy is leading{N}the devils now.{W1}
0DB6=Good weapons and armor, huh?{W1}
0DB7=A statue of a devil's head.{N}It looks ready to bite you.{W1}
0DB8=A statue of a fierce{N}devil's head.  There's a{N}slit at its mouth.{W1}
0DB9=Sir Astral!  {LEADER}!{W1}
0DBA={LEADER}, wait!{W1}
0DBB=May I join your force?{W1}
0DBC=Well...{W1}
0DBD=You can trust me.{N}I'm a born fighter.{W2}
0DBE=As you know, I want to die.{W2}
0DBF=I will die fighting for your{N}cause, if you let me.{W1}
0DC0=He's a hero in Galam.{N}I think he should join us.{W1}
0DC1={NAME;28}, please come{N}with us.  You'll be a great{N}help.{W1}
0DC2=Oh, thank you!  I know I can{N}take the King of the Devils!{W1}
0DC3={W1}
0DC4=Remember.  You're our{N}leader.  We lose when you{N}are defeated.  OK?{W1}
0DC5=(Whinny!)...Oh, I love{N}going into battle!{W1}
0DC6=Stand at attention!{N}Ready for inspection, sir!!{W1}
0DC7=Sir Hawel's teachings are{N}very helpful.  Strategy was{N}his cup o' tea.{W1}
0DC8=I'm like a shadow of the{N}night.  Silent and deadly!{W1}
0DC9=Speaking...tires me.{N}Fighting...tires me.{N}I'm tired.{W1}
0DCA=Phoenix don't need a priest.{N}We can revive ourselves.{W1}
0DCB=I'm a centaur, but I can use{N}a bow and arrows!{W1}
0DCC=Those who are truly strong,{N}like me, don't need weapons!{W1}
0DCD=I love swooping in for the{N}kill!{W1}
0DCE=This is great!  I love this{N}cannon!{W1}
0DCF=We centaurs are the main{N}fighters in a battle!{N}We're awesome!{W1}
0DD0=Enemies from the sky are{N}mine.  My arrows will get{N}them!{W1}
0DD1=I trained a lot when I was{N}younger.  Style is more{N}important than strength.{W1}
0DD2=I'm not afraid of devils!{N}When's the next battle?{W1}
0DD3=I'll face any devil, anytime!{N}Bring 'em on!!{W1}
0DD4=My magic powers should be a{N}great help to you!{W1}
0DD5=I'm afraid of battle, but{N}I'll never run from the{N}enemy!{W1}
0DD6=I'm fully recovered!{N}Where's the enemy?{W1}
0DD7=I'm not as strong as you, so{N}I'll support you from the{N}sky.{W1}
0DD8=The power of nature is much{N}stronger than the devils!{W1}
0DD9=I can't forgive them!{N}Evil must be purged from the{N}Earth!{W1}
0DDA=Why are they so excited?{N}I fight for myself, not for{N}anybody else!{W1}
0DDB=Dwarves are tough.  Put me{N}in the front of the force!{W1}
0DDC=Devils, go away!{N}I'll knock you out!{W1}
0DDD=We have been fighting the{N}devils since the ancient{N}days....{W1}
0DDE=Magic sure is helpful in a{N}battle, isn't it?{W1}
0DDF=Like {NAME;7}, I'll{N}never die.  I don't care{N}how difficult the battle is!{W1}
0DE0=I was created by ancient{N}magic.  It's my destiny{N}to defeat the devils!{W1}
0DE1={W1}
0DE2=Have you ever noticed how{N}short {NAME;3} is?{W1}
0DE3=I'm a lot taller than{N}{NAME;3}.  He, he...(whinny)!{W1}
0DE4=Ouch...{NAME;1} just told me{N}how short I was....{W1}
0DE5=Using magic tires me out.{N}I need to rest a lot.{W1}
0DE6=I'm thinking of a way to{N}steal more treasure after{N}the battle.{W1}
0DE7=I'm practicing...{N}dodge...dodge....{N}(Whew)...I'm tired!{W1}
0DE8={LEADER}, do you think I'm{N}a snob?{N}I heard a rumor about me!{W1}
0DE9=What is Grans like?{N}I'm from the country, so I{N}really like cities!{W1}
0DEA=Grrrr...Grrrrrrr...is that{N}enough?  I try to be brutal.{W1}
0DEB=I prefer the battle area to{N}the Caravan.{W1}
0DEC=The Ancients were so smart!{N}Moving about in a vehicle{N}is wonderful!{W1}
0DED={LEADER}, adventuring{N}with you is more exciting{N}than I expected!{W1}
0DEE=Wow...it sure is nice to{N}rest after a hard battle.{W1}
0DEF=There are many centaurs in{N}this force, but I think I'm{N}the most valuable one!{W1}
0DF0={NAME;3} sure is cute,{N}even if he is kinda short.{W1}
0DF1=Hey, are you crazy?!{N}Put me in battle!{W1}
0DF2=Young men nowadays are so{N}difficult to understand.{N}Am I getting old...?{W1}
0DF3=I'm just happy to be with{N}{NAME;13}!{W1}
0DF4=I can't kill myself.  Why?{N}I'm not a vampire, am I?{W1}
0DF5=Are you surprised to see how{N}fast I grew?{N}So am I!{W1}
0DF6=Mitula looks young, but she{N}is actually quite old.{W1}
0DF7=Blast!{N}This is so exciting!{W1}
0DF8=I like this!  Free food!{W1}
0DF9=Travel is my hobby!{N}See this souvenir?{N}It's for my wife, and....{W1}
0DFA=Let me fight!  C'mon!{N}No one is a match for a{N}master monk!{W1}
0DFB=(Click, click)...oh, I have{N}to oil my body sometimes.{W1}
0DFC=Do I behave haughty?{N}They seldom talk to me.{N}(Sob...sob){W1}
0DFD=Give me your hand...oh, am I{N}still cold?  But, I'm alive.{W1}
0DFE=They say I'm dirty!  Is it{N}because I've never washed{N}my body before?!{W1}
0DFF=You're not devils, are you?{W2}
0E00=How did you get here safely?{W1}
0E01=I'm hungry....{W1}
0E02=Are you strong?  Will you{N}please kill the devils?{W1}
0E03=Pacalon soldiers are so{N}proud!{W2}
0E04=But, they're just cowards{N}that hide in the castle.{W1}
0E05=What will we do when we{N}lose?{W1}
0E06=Do you know Geshp?{W2}
0E07=He sometimes comes here.{N}He seems so friendly.{W2}
0E08=Are all devils like him?{N}If so, I like them.{W1}
0E09=Do you think Pacalon can{N}beat the devils?{W2}
0E0A=Say yes!  Pacalon has the{N}best fighters in the world!{W1}
0E0B=This is Pacalon, a kingdom{N}of fine centaurs.{W2}
0E0C=We welcome you.{W1}
0E0D=Rain!  This must be a{N}present from the gods!{W1}
0E0E=Thanks to the rain, I'm no{N}longer thirsty.{N}But, I'm still hungry.{W1}
0E0F=Did you save Mitula?{W2}
0E10=Then, why don't you defeat{N}those devils?{W1}
0E11=Was Tristan occupied by{N}devils?{W2}
0E12=That's why we've had no{N}rain lately.{W1}
0E13=I see Geshp frequently.{N}He always stares at the{N}castle.{W1}
0E14=Unbelievable!  You've{N}finally arrived.{W1}
0E15=Creed...I mean, Mr...{W1}
0E16=That's OK, {NAME;7}.{N}I doubted you'd ever make{N}it here.{W2}
0E17=The enemies you've faced so{N}far were strong.{W1}
0E18=Yes, they were.{W1}
0E19=Why am I here?  Is that your{N}question, {LEADER}?{W2}
0E1A=I wanted to help you.{W2}
0E1B=There is no church around{N}here.  Think of me as a{N}priest.{W1}
0E1C=Now, what can I do for you?{W1}
0E1D=Who is it?  Petro?{W1}
0E1E=Well, who are you?{W1}
0E1F=Petro?  Is he back?{W1}
0E20=Petro!  The Sky Orb is OUR{N}treasure!  Give it back!{W2}
0E21=Say something!{N}Petro!{W1}
0E22=Oh, you're not Petro.{N}Who...are you?{W1}
0E23=Ancient stone?  Yes, my{N}family had it for a long{N}time.{W2}
0E24=But, it was stolen.{W1}
0E25=His brother, my grandson,{N}took the stone, the Sky Orb,{N}when he left.{W2}
0E26=I think he went to Grans{N}Island to operate an ancient{N}vehicle.{W2}
0E27=I've lost my purpose to live.{W1}
0E28=He spent all his spare time{N}studying the Sky Orb.{W2}
0E29=It is quite old.{N}He deduced that our{N}ancestors could fly.{W2}
0E2A=The last known location of{N}the Nazca Ship was Grans.{W1}
0E2B=You need my help?{W1}
0E2C=Come in.  Talk to me.{W1}
0E2D=I came here looking for{N}ancient treasure, and found{N}the Sky Orb.{W2}
0E2E=Also, I discovered how to{N}use the ancient tunnels.{W2}
0E2F=But, most of them are{N}useless, except for the{N}one to Grans.{W1}
0E30=To Grans?{W1}
0E31=Can we get to Grans Island{N}through it?{W1}
0E32=Yes.  Do you want to go{N}there?{W2}
0E33=Really?{W2}
0E34=You'll go to Grans with me.{N}Let's go now!{W1}
0E35={LEADER} decides to go{N}with him.{W1}
0E36=All I want is the Sky Orb.{N}Just help me get that, and{N}then you can leave.{W1}
0E37=Good luck.{W2}
0E38=If you see my brother,{N}please tell him that I'm OK.{W1}
0E39=Oh, what a pity.{N}You can't go to Grans.{W1}
0E3A=It's my job!{W1}
0E3B=Row...sham...bow!{W1}
0E3C=OK, you go first!{W1}
0E3D=I'm Paseran of Ribble.{N}I'm studying the ancient{N}petroglyphs.{W2}
0E3E={NAME;11} told me about{N}a family who has an ancient{N}tomb in Parmecia.{W2}
0E3F=According to my studies,{N}his house should be around{N}here somewhere.{W2}
0E40=Or, maybe it's to the east.{W1}
0E41=I feel...a power returning{N}me to human.{W2}
0E42=Hey!  The evil is gone!{N}Did you chase them away?{W1}
0E43={LEADER}, who is she?{W1}
0E44=Did you say {LEADER}?{N}Oh, you're from Granseal!{W1}
0E45=Yes, we are, but who are{N}you?{W1}
0E46=Do you know how long I've{N}been here as a stone statue?{W1}
0E47=How do you know {LEADER}?{W1}
0E48=Oh, I'm sorry.{W2}
0E49=I'm {NAME;21}, a sorceress.{N}Goddess Mitula told me about{N}you.{W1}
0E4A=She did?{W1}
0E4B=Yes.  She was worried about{N}you.{W2}
0E4C=You are fated to fight Zeon.{W2}
0E4D=But, she is unable to help{N}you.  It's an order from{N}Volcanon.{W2}
0E4E=But, I'm here for her.{N}I'm here to help you.{W1}
0E4F=You want to go to Grans,{N}right?  Then, I think we{N}can use the ancient ship.{W2}
0E50=Let's go to Nazca.{W1}
0E51=Arc Valley is a dark place{N}where evil gathers.{W2}
0E52=He who rules Arc Valley is{N}the King of the Devils.{W1}
0E53=Dark Sol, Dark Dragon and{N}Zeon fought desperately to{N}obtain Arc Valley.{W2}
0E54=The fighting of the devil{N}kings created a mighty storm.{W1}
0E55=Zeon won.  And every devil{N}named him the King of the{N}Devils.{W2}
0E56=The other two kings envied{N}Zeon.  They sealed his powers{N}inside the Jewel of Evil.{W1}
0E57=When Zeon lost his powers,{N}he fell to Earth, and created{N}a giant crater when he hit.{W2}
0E58=His moan destroyed the{N}mountains and the crater{N}was buried by the debris.{W1}
0E59=Grieving over the fight, the{N}God of Wisdom created the{N}Jewel of Light.{W2}
0E5A=The Jewel of Light chose a{N}brave man and gave him the{N}Holy Sword.{W1}
0E5B=With the Holy Sword in{N}hand, the brave man fought{N}against the two devil kings.{W2}
0E5C=The Holy Sword contained{N}holy power.  Thus, the two{N}devil kings were defeated.{W1}
0E5D=Evil Arc Valley was sealed{N}beneath the Ancient Tower.{W2}
0E5E=Never open the door to the{N}tower.  A great evil sleeps{N}inside.{W1}
0E5F=In the event of Zeon{N}awakening, the power of light{N}will choose another.{W2}
0E60=Believe us.  We lie not.{N}Attack the devil at his mouth{N}with the Holy Sword.{W1}
0E61={LEADER} defeated Red{N}Baron too?  Is that what{N}you said, Geshp?{W1}
0E62=Yes, sir...I'm sorry.{W1}
0E63=Once again, my minions have{N}failed me.{W2}
0E64=Are my soldiers that weak?{W1}
0E65=Yes...oh, no!  I mean, they{N}were strong enough.{W2}
0E66=But {LEADER} and his force{N}were smarter.{W1}
0E67=No more excuses!{W2}
0E68=This is your last chance.{N}Kill {LEADER} this time,{N}or I'll kill you!{W1}
0E69=Ah...yes, sir.  I'll kill{N}{LEADER} this time.{N}I stake my life on it.{W1}
0E6A=Bring the Jewel of Evil back{N}to me!{W1}
0E6B=Yes, sir!{W1}
0E6C=You were right, Odd Eye.{W1}
0E6D=Of course.{W1}
0E6E=I can't trust Geshp anymore.{W2}
0E6F=If he fails, you must battle{N}{LEADER}.{W1}
0E70=You want me to kill{N}{LEADER}?{W2}
0E71=He's probably much stronger{N}now.{N}Hmmm, sounds interesting.{W2}
0E72=I'll do it.  If this comes{N}to pass, it will be his final{N}battle.{W1}
0E73={LEADER} is almost here{N}already?{W1}
0E74=Yes, sir.  With an ancient{N}aircraft.  He'll be passing{N}over the cape soon.{W1}
0E75=Good.  I'll do anything to{N}get my powers back.{W1}
0E76=They're stronger than we{N}thought.{W2}
0E77=But, I have an idea.  Please{N}let me try it.{W1}
0E78=Well?{W1}
0E79=I think it's better for us{N}to shoot them down over the{N}
0E7A=cape.{W1}
0E7B=I agree.{W1}
0E7C=Thank you.  Then... may I{W2}
0E7D=borrow Odd Eye?{W1}
0E7E=He's still damaged from his{N}battle against Volcanon.{W2}
0E7F=Take Red Baron instead.{W1}
0E80=Thank you, sir.{W1}
0E81=They'll be passing over the{N}cape soon.  Go!{W1}
0E82=Yes, sir!{W1}
0E83=That Geshp!  He wants{N}everything.{W1}
0E84=You noticed that too?{W1}
0E85=Yes, King Zeon.{W2}
0E86=I'm afraid Geshp can't stop{N}{LEADER}'s advance.{W1}
0E87=You really think so?{W1}
0E88=I was just thinking of{N}{LEADER}'s hidden powers.{W2}
0E89=We must never underestimate{N}him.{W1}
0E8A=Anyway, it will be a{N}fantastic show!  Ha, ha!{W1}
0E8B=Finish the preparations{N}before the Nazca Ship flies{N}over the cape!{W1}
0E8C=How are the Prism Flowers?{W1}
0E8D=They're ready!{W1}
0E8E=Excellent!{W1}
0E8F=Now, c'mon Granseal losers!{W2}
0E90=The Prism Flowers are waiting{N}for you!  Hee, heee!{W1}
0E91=There's Grans Island!{W1}
0E92=Alright!{W1}
0E93=We've finally come home.{W1}
0E94=I see the Nazca Ship!{N}Everybody, get ready!{W1}
0E95=What's that?  I saw a flash{N}of light over there.{W1}
0E96=I didn't see it.  You must be{N}seeing things because you're{N}so old!  Ha, ha!{W1}
0E97=(Grumble)....{W2}
0E98=Someday, {NAME;7}....{W1}
0E99=NOW!{W1}
0E9A=Shoot them!  Shoot them!{W1}
0E9B=I did see something!{W1}
0E9C=Well, I didn't.{W1}
0E9D=This could be bad.{W1}

0F0C={NAME;7} shakes her{N}wildly.{W1}
0F0D=Elis does not respond.{W1}
0F0E=She's so cold, and looks so{N}pale.{W2}
0F0F=Sir Astral, is she dead?{W1}
0F10=I don't think so.{N}Let me see her.{W1}
0F11=Astral examines Elis.{W1}
0F12=No. She's cold, but she's{N}breathing.{W2}
0F13=I don't understand....{W1}
0F14=She's in a coma.{W1}
0F15=Goddess Mitula...?{W1}

0F1D=When?{W1}
0F1E=You doubt me?{W2}
0F1F=How about {NAME;28}?{N}God Volcanon protected him{N}from the fire.{W1}
0F20=Really?  But he said, he{N}would forsake the people{N}of the earth.{W1}
0F21=He said that to deceive the{N}devils.{W2}
0F22=If he had joined you at{N}that time, Zeon would've{N}come to Parmecia.{W2}
0F23=The entire continent might{N}have been destroyed.{W2}
0F24=And if Volcanon had joined{N}you, you would've leaned{N}on him, wouldn't you have?{W1}
0F25=The Jewel of Light was made{N}by him, wasn't it?{W2}
0F26=It protected {NAME;28}, right?{W1}
0F27=You're very smart, Astral.{W1}
0F28=I have to go now.{W2}

0F2B=And I need the Jewel of Evil.{W1}
0F2C=Mitula took the Jewel{N}of Evil.{W1}
0F2D=I have to seal Zeon before{N}he regains his power.{W2}
0F2E=You had better leave now.{N}Arc Valley will be destroyed.{W1}
0F2F=One more thing!{W1}
0F30=Yes?{W1}
0F31=How do we wake Elis up?{W1}
0F32=She has been poisoned.{W2}
0F33=When the poison leaves her{N}body, her face will turn pink.{W1}
0F34=Then she will awaken?{W1}
0F35=If she's still sleeping, she{N}will need a kiss from her{N}true love.{W2}
0F36=This kiss will awaken her.{W1}
0F37=When will the poison leave?{W1}
0F38=I have no idea.  It depends{N}on her physical strength.{W2}
0F39=It may take a few months...{N}or a few years.{W2}
0F3A=Now, I must go.{N}Good luck.{W1}
0F3B=She's gone.{W1}

0F3D=Sir Astral, c'mon!{W2}
0F3E=Mitula told us to leave.{W1}

0F43={LEADER}, run!{W1}
0F44=Two years have passed{N}since Mitula resealed Zeon.{W1}
0F45=Wow, is it true?{N}Did Elis' face turn pink?{W1}
0F46=Why am I here?{W2}
0F47=We have no more enemies.{W1}
0F48=Wait, wait!{W2}
0F49=Sir Astral told me not to{N}let you go out today!{W2}
0F4A=You have to be here.{W1}
0F4B=I envy you.{N}I'm an old woman now.{W2}
0F4C=Nobody kisses me anymore.{W1}
0F4D=You're wrong!{W2}
0F4E=I'll kiss you!{W1}
0F4F={LEADER}, did you hear?{W2}
0F50=The Princess' face turned{N}pink!{W1}
0F51=Ah, {LEADER}!{N}I'm so happy!{W2}
0F52=I heard Princess Elis is{N}going to awaken today!{W1}
0F53=Thanks to Galam and{N}Pacalon, Granseal is{N}now the same as before!{W1}
0F54=Galam is making a statue of{N}{NAME;28} as a memorial.{W1}
0F55={LEADER}, you...will...{N}kiss...her...?{W2}
0F56=I don't like you anymore.{N}(Sigh){W1}
0F57=I'm so happy.  I'll get to{N}see Elis again!{W1}
0F58={NAME;2} had better not{N}be the one who kisses her.{W2}
0F59=If he kisses her, he'll have{N}my hoofprints on his rump!{W1}
0F5A=I heard a rumor!{N}Are you going to kiss her?{W2}
0F5B=Shucks, I wish I were as{N}young as you.{W1}
0F5C=Morning, {LEADER}.{W2}
0F5D=Are you ready to go to{N}the castle?{W1}
0F5E=I know somebody must kiss{N}her....{W2}
0F5F=Who will it be?{N}What will I do if...{N}it's...?{W1}
0F60=I don't think it's going to{N}be me 'cause I'm a centaur.{W2}
0F61=Who will it be?{N}Does Sir Astral know?{W1}
0F62=I will do anything for{N}Princess Elis!!{W2}
0F63=I hope Sir Astral chooses{N}me!{W1}
0F64=She's no longer poisoned,{N}but she's still asleep.{W2}
0F65=And Sir Astral called us{N}here!{N}Who's going to kiss her?{W1}
0F66={LEADER}!{W2}

0F6F={NAME;2} told me about{N}it, but it's better than I{N}pictured!{W1}
0F70=Hello, {LEADER}!{N}You look good!{W2}
0F71=The Caravan is working well!{N}I found some more ruins!{N}Ha, ha, ha!{W1}
0F72=Sir Astral invited{N}{NAME;7} and I.{W2}
0F73=It's hard to believe there{N}was ever a threat of evil!{W1}
0F74=King Pacalon asked me to say{N}hello to you.{W2}
0F75=He should see this beautiful{N}castle.{W1}
0F76=Two years...since that{N}battle....{W2}
0F77=I hope {NAME;28} is OK.{W1}

0F79={LEADER}, you were{N}younger than the Princess,{N}but now you're older!{W1}

0F80=Please explain what is{N}happening.{W1}

0F83=It took two years, but the{N}Princess finally recovered{N}from the poison.{W2}
0F84=But she's still sleeping.{N}We've decided to take{N}Mitula's advice.{W1}
0F85=Mitula...you mean, somebody{N}gets to kiss her?{W1}
0F86=Yes.{N}We feel this is the right{N}time.{W1}
0F87=And we need to decide which{N}one of you will kiss{N}Elis.{W1}
0F88=We don't have to decide.{N}It's {LEADER}.{N}{NAME;10}, don't you agree?{W1}
0F89=Ha, ha!  Yes, {NAME;7}!{W2}
0F8A=I always thought {LEADER}{N}was the best choice!{W1}

0F8D=I understand what my friends{N}are saying, but...I love{N}her.{W2}
0F8E=May I kiss her?{N}Somebody, say yes!{W1}
0F8F=Sorry, but...I don't think{N}{NAME;3} is the right{N}choice.{W1}
0F90=I understand {NAME;3}, but{N}she is a human.{W2}
0F91=A human is the best choice.{W1}
0F92={LEADER} is a human!{N}They will make a cute couple!{W1}
0F93={LEADER} is a good lad{N}with the manner of a{N}knight!{W2}
