FORMAT:
- Each letter is 32 bytes.
- The lower half of byte 1 represents that character's width in pixels.
  0 will be 0 pixels, and F will be 15 pixels, and so on.
- The upper half of byte 1 is ignored.
- Characters may be up to 15 pixels wide, but there is only space for 12 pixels wide of graphical data.
- The pixels will overlap if there are set pixels beyond the edge of the width that character has been defined as having.
- The following 15 pairs of bytes represent each row of the character.
- To determine if a pixel is set or unset, check each bit. A 0 is unset, a 1 is set.
- The leftmost pixel corresponds with the leftmost bit, and it continues in order, from left to right.
- The upper half of byte 2,4,6... represents pixels 1,2,3,4 of each row.
- The lower half of byte 2,4,6... represents pixels 5,6,7,8 of each row.
- The upper half of byte 3,5,7... represents pixels 9,10,11,12 of each row.
- The lower half of byte 3,5,7... is ignored.
- A set pixel is color 15 in palette 2.
- An unset pixel is color 1 in palette 2.

For example, a byte pair of 3F C0 would result in this binary pattern:
00111111 11000000
so the first two pixels are unset, the next 8 are set, and the last 2 are not set for that row.
