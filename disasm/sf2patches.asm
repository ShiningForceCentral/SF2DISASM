; Fixes
;
; Note that the following fixes are always being applied to the standard build :
; - FIX_CARAVAN_DESCRIPTIONS
; - FIX_CARAVAN_FREE_REPAIR_EXPLOIT -- Turning this off will reproduce the exploit, however the inventory will still be limited.
; - FIX_SPELL_LEARNING_PROMO_CHECK
;
FIX_AI_CLAUDE_ATTACK_RANGE:          equ 1   ; Corrects an oversight resulting in AI-controlled Claude to attack with the same 1-2 range as the Kraken Arm enemy.
FIX_BATTLE_TO_MOUN_SKIP:             equ 1   ; Sets the Egress map to Pacalon after Frayja asks to go to Moun, preventing the battle to Moun to be skipped by egressing to Tristan.
FIX_CARAVAN_DESCRIPTIONS:            equ 1   ; Breaks up character list into chunks of 4.
FIX_CARAVAN_FREE_REPAIR_EXPLOIT:     equ 1   ; Preserves the broken bit when items are stored in the Caravan, though as a result, inventory size must be halved to 32 items.
FIX_COPY_SWAP_EXPLOIT:               equ 1   ; Some game data will be carried over from a previous file to a new one when deleting a save after copying it. Known items include: Character EXP, kills and defeats, item dropped flags, and queued up Mithril items.
FIX_COUNT_DEFEATED_ENEMIES:          equ 1   ; Fixes the death counter that impacts "swarm AI" for battles 16, 20, 21. In vanilla, does not impact battles 16, 20, but makes 21 more aggressive.
FIX_CRITICAL_HIT_DEFINITIONS:        equ 1   ; Makes the "Increase Critical" equipeffect increase chance while never impacting damage potential.
FIX_DWARVEN_MINER_VOICE:             equ 1   ; A cutscene has a fairy NPC concluding her dialogue, and when the dwarf delivers his first line, it uses the same female NPC speech sound effect until his follow-up dialogue line.
FIX_ELIS_DIALOGUE_ASSIGNMENT:        equ 1   ; A line of dialogue used during the cutscene in the tower underground room before Granseal's destruction is wrongly assigned to Bowie.
FIX_ELIS_SPEECH_SFX:                 equ 1   ; Corrects Elis's speech SFX when using MAPSPRITE_POSE6.
FIX_ENEMY_BATTLE_EQUIP:              equ 1   ; Enemies will equip battle items as designated in the battle spriteset.
FIX_EXPLORATION_MAGIC_MENU_ICONS:    equ 1   ; Applies the index mask $3F to spell entries when populating the currently displayed icons table.
FIX_FIELD_ITEM_CONSUMABLE:           equ 1   ; Field items will only be consumed if the CONSUMABLE flag is set.
FIX_GARBLED_HP_BAR:                  equ 1   ; Prevents drawing garbage pixels when HP is greater then 600 by continuing to draw black bars instead.
FIX_GIZMO_ARRANGEMENT:               equ 1   ; Moves the Gizmo enemies during the before battle cutscene to positions matching the battle formation.
FIX_GODDESS_STAFF_DEALS_EXPLOIT:     equ 1   ; If one of the following items is sitting in the Deals section after a DEF-CON switch is activated: Quick Ring, Protect Ring, White Ring, or Running Ring; a Goddess Staff will also be added to Deals.
FIX_GOLD_GIFT:                       equ 1   ; Gold increases when Minister gives you gift in New Granseal.
FIX_HIGINS_SPELL:                    equ 1   ; Prevents unequipping from possibly corrupting characters spell entries.
FIX_INCREASE_DOUBLE_RESETS_COUNTER:  equ 1   ; Equipment that increases the chance to double attack also erroneously set the chance to counter attack to 1/32.
FIX_AI_JARO_NOT_LEAVING_THE_FORCE:   equ 1   ; Resets Jaro's stats, makes him leave the battle party and the Force, and clears the flag indicating that he switched sides when leaving battle 32 (en route to Moun) before completing it.
FIX_KARNA_INCREASED_DOUBLE:          equ 1   ; 1 = No increased double, 2 = Sheela gets increased double instead.  An oddity in the character initialization routine causes the chance to double attack to be increased if the character happens to start knowing Heal 3.
FIX_KIWI_BREATH_UPGRADE_LEVELS:      equ 1   ; Kiwi's breath upgrades are based on effective rather than current level.
FIX_LABYRINTH_DELETION:              equ 1   ; Prevents a section of the labyrinth from being deleted due to AI region activation.
FIX_MEMBER_GOLD_MENU_GLITCH:         equ 1   ; The gold window displayed on the member status screen should only be 4 tiles tall rather than 12. This fixes a visual glitch in the lower-left corner of screen.
FIX_MISSING_RANDOM_BATTLES:          equ 1   ; Adds zone events for random battles without.
FIX_MOVEMENT_GLITCH:                 equ 1   ; The movement glitch is used in battles to reach places which are out of the controlled character's moving boundaries.
FIX_PRISM_FLOWER_OVERWORLD_ENTRANCE: equ 1   ; On Map 77, walking to the right on the tile closest to the bottom mountain brings the player into the Prism Flower battle rather than to the world map to the right.
FIX_RANGED_COUNTER_EXP:              equ 1   ; Switches focus to ally target before giving EXP if a counterattack occurred.
FIX_SEARCH_IN_BATTLE:                equ 1   ; Restores the ability to search chests during battle.

FIX_TIMER_WINDOW_POSITION:           equ 1   ; Re-positions the timer window displayed during the Fairy Woods special stage battle to perfectly overlap the gold window when viewing the member status screen.
FIX_USABLE_ITEM_VALIDATION:          equ 1   ; Compares an item's Use Spell index to the "No spell" index $3F instead of $FF.
FIX_SLADE_EXPLODES_AFTER_BATTLE_5:   equ 1   ; Fixes the bug where at the end of battle 5, if you kill the Galam Knight and at least one other target simultaneously, then Slade explodes during post-battle cutscene.
